## Course Summary and Key Take-aways

### Course Summary

### My Key Takeaways

[back to top](#top)

## How do People Perceive Information?

### L1: Visual Perception, Part 1

- Principles
	+ make important info & actions visible
	+ Leverage "the read"
		* i.e. the F-shape pattern
	+ When evaluating, ask yourself, "did they see it?"

### L2: Visual Perception, Part 2

- Three stages
	+ features (colors, shapes, lines)
	+ patterns
	+ interpret those patterns as objects
- Feature Detection
	+ Color => we see this instantly
	+ Value => light to dark
	+ Angles =>
	+ Slope
	+ Length
	+ Tectures => smooth, bumpy, etc.
	+ Motion
	+ Feature detection happens very quickly
	+ Allows "pop-out" of certain distinc colors, shapes, etc.
	+ Supports subsequent stages:
		* patterns and objects
- First Stage: Feature Detection
- Second Stage: Patterns
- Pattern Identification: Gestalt Principles
	+ Proximity
	+ Closure and continuation
		* think of the incomplete circle
	+ symmetry
	+ similarity
	+ common area
		* objects within a closed area
	+ common fate
- Principles
	+ Use "pop out" (primitive features) to attract attention
	+ Use Gestalt principles to associate like items
	+ Use Gestalt principles to organize for skippability
- Zappos page:
	+ boots are photographed in the same orientation to make it easy to compare
	+ breaks the similarity to allow people to navigate around the page and focus on the things they want to focus on

### L3: Memory, Part 1

- From the senses to memory:
	+ Sensory Register => Perception => Short-term Memory => Long-term Memory
	+ Sensory Register
		* requires attention
		* a small amount of what is available is actually perceived
	+ Perception
		* whatever is perceived is avaiable for thought - but only briefly
	+ Short term memory
		* relatively to small amount of information is "learned" (committed from short-term to long-term memory)
	+ focusing on short-term memory in this lecture
- Short-term Memory
	+ limited capacity
		* the "magic number" 7 +/- 2 items (Miller's Law)
		* Maybe more like 4 +/- 1
	+ Information that is not retained is lost
		* "Retained" means "committed to long-term memory"
- Principles
	+ Keep lists of options short
	+ Give users tools for reducing options
	+ Don't expect users to remember stuff

### L4: Memory, Part 1

- Long Term Memory
	+ anything remembered for more than a few seconds
	+ must be "copied" from short-term to long-term
- Transfer to Long-Term Memory
	+ Association
		* associated with something that you already know
	+ Repetition
- Memorization
	+ "Elaborative rehearsal"
		* expending effort to commit something to long-term memory
- Associative vs. Elaborative
	+ Which is easier for a user? **Associative**
	+ Which is most likely to be remembered? **Associative**
- Likelihood of Remembering
	+ Strength of association
	+ Recency
	+ Frequency
- Principles
	+ Learning will work better if learner can fit into a schema
		* use metaphors
		* leverage standards and consistency
		* Avoid asking users to memorize stuff
	+ Prefer recognition over recall
- Leverage Consistency and Standards
	+ Think of Google Docs, Google Sheets, and Microsoft Word => they all have common / similar menu structures
- Avoid asking users to memorize stuff
	+ complicated password requirements
- Prioritize recognition over recall
	+ provide menu options (i.e. autocomplete options when searching)

### Section Summary and Quiz

- Human visual processing:
	+ primitive visual features (color, contrast, angle, length, and slope of lines, texture, motion)
	+ gestalt principles for pattern-forming (proximity, closure and continuation, symmetry, similarity, common fate, common area) 
- Memory
	- characteristics of short-term memory (size and duration)
	- characteristics of long-term memory (association, schema, recall, elaborative rehearsal)
* Quiz Answers:
	- The “central vision” portion of the human field of view, in which people can read text and recognize details in images, is approximately 5 degrees
	- Primitive visual features include:
		+ angle of intersection
		+ shade / contrast
		+ motion
	- NOT included:
		+ proximity
	- **schema**: a collection of associated concepts in long-term memory

## How Do People Act in the World?

### L5: Seven Stages of Action

- Don Norman's "Design of Everyday Things"
- Seven stages of action
	+ Forming the goal
	+ Forming the intention
	+ Selects the action
	+ executing the action
	+ perceiving the state of the world (post action)
	+ interpret the state of the world
	+ evaluating the outcome
	+ (implied 8th step: update their goal => did their action change what they wanted it to do)

[back to top](#top)

### L6: Gulfs of Execution and Evaluation

- Gulfs of Execution are on the left side of the Seven states of action
	+ forming the intention
	+ selecting the action
	+ executing the action
- Gulfs of Execution
	+ perceiving the state of the world
	+ interpret state of the world
	+ evaluating the outcome
- Gulf of Execution: Bridging
	+ think of the push bar on a door
	+ bad example: wordy signs on a door indicate which side of the door to push
- Briding the Gulfs
	+ Understand
		* users' goals
		* how they think about accomplishing them
	+ Make sure likely actions are:
		* visible when needed
		* make sense
	+ Make sure the results of actions
		* are visible
		* make sense

### L7: Design Principles

- Discoverability
	+ Discoverability is how we bridge the Gulfs of Execution and Evaluation
	+ Users need to be able to discover
		* what a system can do
		* how to operate it
	+ Execution: users can figure out what actions are possible
	+ Evaluation: users can discover whether actions were successful
- Supporting Discoverability
	+ Affordances
	+ Signifiers
	+ Feedback
	+ Constraints
	+ Conceptual Models
- Affordances
	+ an "affordance" is a feature of an object or environment that indicates the possibility of action
	+ think of a doorknob
		+ or a button
* Signifier
	- An indication of "what" action will occur and, in many cases, where the action can occur
	- think of a sign
		+ i.e. two buttons, one green, one red; green says "start", red says "stop"
		+ or a walking path in a field
* Affordances and Signifiers: Great Together
	- Affordances if done well, can communicate intuitively
	- Signifiers are often necessary when many actions are possible
	- Conventions and standards can reduce need for affordance
* Feedback
	- users need to know that the system recieved their input
	- users need to know what the system did with their input
* Constraints
	- Unavailable actions should be disabled
	- Limit the total number of options will make selection easier
* Conceptual Models
	- conceptual models support *simulation of future actions*
		+ anticipate what will happen for things they haven't done yet
	- appropriate use of affordances, signifiers, feedback and constrains leads to formation of *accurate conceptual models*
* Support Formation of Conceptual Models
	- the originals:
		+ Affordances
		* Signifiers
		* Feedback
		* Constraints
		* Conceptual Models
	+ new ones:
		* Consistency
		* Metaphors
- Metaphors
	+ folder or file => represents documents
	+ trash carn => delete a file or folder, etc.
	+ shopping cart =>

### Section Wrap-up Notes

- **Affordance**: A feature of an environment or system that, by its shape and appearance, suggests to a person that a particular action could be taken
- **Signifier**: A feature of an environment or system that communicates through verbiage or imagery what will happen if an action is taken
