# Principles of Designing for Humans

## How do People Perceive Information?

### L1: Visual Perception, Part 1

- Principles
	+ make important info & actions visible
	+ Leverage "the read"
		* i.e. the F-shape pattern
	+ When evaluating, ask yourself, "did they see it?"

### L2: Visual Perception, Part 2

- Three stages
	+ features (colors, shapes, lines)
	+ patterns
	+ interpret those patterns as objects
- Feature Detection
	+ Color => we see this instantly
	+ Value => light to dark
	+ Angles =>
	+ Slope
	+ Length
	+ Tectures => smooth, bumpy, etc.
	+ Motion
	+ Feature detection happens very quickly
	+ Allows "pop-out" of certain distinc colors, shapes, etc.
	+ Supports subsequent stages:
		* patterns and objects
- First Stage: Feature Detection
- Second Stage: Patterns
- Pattern Identification: Gestalt Principles
	+ Proximity
	+ Closure and continuation
		* think of the incomplete circle
	+ symmetry
	+ similarity
	+ common area
		* objects within a closed area
	+ common fate
- Principles
	+ Use "pop out" (primitive features) to attract attention
	+ Use Gestalt principles to associate like items
	+ Use Gestalt principles to organize for skippability
- Zappos page:
	+ boots are photographed in the same orientation to make it easy to compare
	+ breaks the similarity to allow people to navigate around the page and focus on the things they want to focus on

### L3: Memory, Part 1

- From the senses to memory:
	+ Sensory Register => Perception => Short-term Memory => Long-term Memory
	+ Sensory Register
		* requires attention
		* a small amount of what is available is actually perceived
	+ Perception
		* whatever is perceived is avaiable for thought - but only briefly
	+ Short term memory
		* relatively to small amount of information is "learned" (committed from short-term to long-term memory)
	+ focusing on short-term memory in this lecture
- Short-term Memory
	+ limited capacity
		* the "magic number" 7 +/- 2 items (Miller's Law)
		* Maybe more like 4 +/- 1
	+ Information that is not retained is lost
		* "Retained" means "committed to long-term memory"
- Principles
	+ Keep lists of options short
	+ Give users tools for reducing options
	+ Don't expect users to remember stuff
