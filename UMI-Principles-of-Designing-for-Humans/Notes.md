## How do People Perceive Information?

### L1: Visual Perception, Part 1

- Principles
	+ make important info & actions visible
	+ Leverage "the read"
		* i.e. the F-shape pattern
	+ When evaluating, ask yourself, "did they see it?"

### L2: Visual Perception, Part 2

- Three stages
	+ features (colors, shapes, lines)
	+ patterns
	+ interpret those patterns as objects
- Feature Detection
	+ Color => we see this instantly
	+ Value => light to dark
	+ Angles =>
	+ Slope
	+ Length
	+ Tectures => smooth, bumpy, etc.
	+ Motion
	+ Feature detection happens very quickly
	+ Allows "pop-out" of certain distinc colors, shapes, etc.
	+ Supports subsequent stages:
		* patterns and objects
- First Stage: Feature Detection
- Second Stage: Patterns
- Pattern Identification: Gestalt Principles
	+ Proximity
	+ Closure and continuation
		* think of the incomplete circle
	+ symmetry
	+ similarity
	+ common area
		* objects within a closed area
	+ common fate
- Principles
	+ Use "pop out" (primitive features) to attract attention
	+ Use Gestalt principles to associate like items
	+ Use Gestalt principles to organize for skippability
- Zappos page:
	+ boots are photographed in the same orientation to make it easy to compare
	+ breaks the similarity to allow people to navigate around the page and focus on the things they want to focus on
-

### L3: Memory, Part 1

- From the senses to memory:
	+ Sensory Register => Perception => Short-term Memory => Long-term Memory
	+ Sensory Register
		* requires attention
		* a small amount of what is available is actually perceived
	+ Perception
		* whatever is perceived is avaiable for thought - but only briefly
	+ Short term memory
		* relatively to small amount of information is "learned" (committed from short-term to long-term memory)
	+ focusing on short-term memory in this lecture
- Short-term Memory
	+ limited capacity
		* the "magic number" 7 +/- 2 items (Miller's Law)
		* Maybe more like 4 +/- 1
	+ Information that is not retained is lost
		* "Retained" means "committed to long-term memory"
- Principles
	+ Keep lists of options short
	+ Give users tools for reducing options
	+ Don't expect users to remember stuff

[back to top](#top)

### L4: Memory, Part 1

- Long Term Memory
	+ anything remembered for more than a few seconds
	+ must be "copied" from short-term to long-term
- Transfer to Long-Term Memory
	+ Association
		* associated with something that you already know
	+ Repetition
- Memorization
	+ "Elaborative rehearsal"
		* expending effort to commit something to long-term memory
- Associative vs. Elaborative
	+ Which is easier for a user? **Associative**
	+ Which is most likely to be remembered? **Associative**
- Likelihood of Remembering
	+ Strength of association
	+ Recency
	+ Frequency
- Principles
	+ Learning will work better if learner can fit into a schema
		* use metaphors
		* leverage standards and consistency
		* Avoid asking users to memorize stuff
	+ Prefer recognition over recall
- Leverage Consistency and Standards
	+ Think of Google Docs, Google Sheets, and Microsoft Word => they all have common / similar menu structures
- Avoid asking users to memorize stuff
	+ complicated password requirements
- Prioritize recognition over recall
	+ provide menu options (i.e. autocomplete options when searching)

### Section Summary and Quiz

- Human visual processing:
	+ primitive visual features (color, contrast, angle, length, and slope of lines, texture, motion)
	+ gestalt principles for pattern-forming (proximity, closure and continuation, symmetry, similarity, common fate, common area) 
- Memory
	- characteristics of short-term memory (size and duration)
	- characteristics of long-term memory (association, schema, recall, elaborative rehearsal)
* Quiz Answers:
	- The “central vision” portion of the human field of view, in which people can read text and recognize details in images, is approximately 5 degrees
	- Primitive visual features include:
		+ angle of intersection
		+ shade / contrast
		+ motion
	- NOT included:
		+ proximity
	- **schema**: a collection of associated concepts in long-term memory

## How Do People Act in the World?

### L5: Seven Stages of Action

- Don Norman's "Design of Everyday Things"
- Seven stages of action
	+ Forming the goal
	+ Forming the intention
	+ Selects the action
	+ executing the action
	+ perceiving the state of the world (post action)
	+ interpret the state of the world
	+ evaluating the outcome
	+ (implied 8th step: update their goal => did their action change what they wanted it to do)

[back to top](#top)

### L6: Gulfs of Execution and Evaluation

- Gulfs of Execution are on the left side of the Seven states of action
	+ forming the intention
	+ selecting the action
	+ executing the action
- Gulfs of Execution
	+ perceiving the state of the world
	+ interpret state of the world
	+ evaluating the outcome
- Gulf of Execution: Bridging
	+ think of the push bar on a door
	+ bad example: wordy signs on a door indicate which side of the door to push
- Briding the Gulfs
	+ Understand
		* users' goals
		* how they think about accomplishing them
	+ Make sure likely actions are:
		* visible when needed
		* make sense
	+ Make sure the results of actions
		* are visible
		* make sense

[back to top](#top)

### L7: Design Principles

- Discoverability
	+ Discoverability is how we bridge the Gulfs of Execution and Evaluation
	+ Users need to be able to discover
		* what a system can do
		* how to operate it
	+ Execution: users can figure out what actions are possible
	+ Evaluation: users can discover whether actions were successful
- Supporting Discoverability
	+ Affordances
	+ Signifiers
	+ Feedback
	+ Constraints
	+ Conceptual Models
- Affordances
	+ an "affordance" is a feature of an object or environment that indicates the possibility of action
	+ think of a doorknob
		+ or a button
* Signifier
	- An indication of "what" action will occur and, in many cases, where the action can occur
	- think of a sign
		+ i.e. two buttons, one green, one red; green says "start", red says "stop"
		+ or a walking path in a field
* Affordances and Signifiers: Great Together
	- Affordances if done well, can communicate intuitively
	- Signifiers are often necessary when many actions are possible
	- Conventions and standards can reduce need for affordance
* Feedback
	- users need to know that the system recieved their input
	- users need to know what the system did with their input
* Constraints
	- Unavailable actions should be disabled
	- Limit the total number of options will make selection easier
* Conceptual Models
	- conceptual models support *simulation of future actions*
		+ anticipate what will happen for things they haven't done yet
	- appropriate use of affordances, signifiers, feedback and constrains leads to formation of *accurate conceptual models*
* Support Formation of Conceptual Models
	- the originals:
		+ Affordances
		* Signifiers
		* Feedback
		* Constraints
		* Conceptual Models
	+ new ones:
		* Consistency
		* Metaphors
- Metaphors
	+ folder or file => represents documents
	+ trash carn => delete a file or folder, etc.
	+ shopping cart =>

### Section Wrap-up Notes

- **Affordance**: A feature of an environment or system that, by its shape and appearance, suggests to a person that a particular action could be taken
- **Signifier**: A feature of an environment or system that communicates through verbiage or imagery what will happen if an action is taken

## Design Heuristics

### L8: Heuristics for Design

- From Knowledge to GUidelines
	+ Important to understand
		* how people perceive
		* how people remember
		* how people act to pursue goals
	+ How can system designs use this knowledge to improve UX?
		* A: "Guidelines"
- Example page of guidelines for government web pages: [https://webstandards.hhs.gov/guidelines/](https://webstandards.hhs.gov/guidelines/)
	+ one drawback to the above usability guidelines is that they aren't applicable to every site or scenario
	+ another is that super-detailed guidelines
- Guidelines
	+ There are many out there
	+ you could any set
	+ Choosing guidelines:
		* are they well-supported and focused on user experience?
		* Do they cover all the important best practices?
		* Do they apply to your platform/situation?
		* Are they easy to use?
- Jakob Nielsen's 10 Heuristics
	+ "Heuristic" means "rule of thumb"
		* slightly more general than a "guideline"
	+ Derived from a sustematic review of usability problems
	+ intended to be a small, complete and usable set
	+ able to be taught in a few hours
	+ well-supported by theories of perception and cognition
- 10 Heuristics
	1. Visibility of system status
	2. match between system and the real world
	3. User control and freedom
	4. Consistency and standards
	5. Error prevention
	6. Recognition rather than recall
	7. Flexibility and efficiency of use
	8. Aesthetic and minimalist design
	9. Help users recognize, diagnose and recover from errors
	10. Help and documentation

[back to top](#top)

### L9: Heuristic #1: Visibility of System Status

- Visibility of System Status
	+ the system should always keep users informed about what is going on, through appropriate feedback within a reasonable time
	+ Why?
		* knowing what actions are available bridges the Gulf of Execution
		* Knowing how the system responded bridges the Gulf of Evaluation
		* Echoes Norman's principles of Feedback and Constraints
	+ It manifests in a number of ways throughout the system:
		* Feedback
		* General Availability
	+ Feedback
		* simple things like underlining a link when you hover over it
		* If you mark conversations as "read" in Gmail, you get a little message that says that
		* Available actions: if you can't do a certain action but the button is there, the button is disabled
	+ General Availability
		* is it busy or loading? Show a loading image
		* Show a progress bar if you need more time
		* How users react to delay:
			- Less than 100 milliseconds: "instantaneous"
			- Up to 1.0 second: tolerable but delay is noticeable
			- Up to 10 seconds: annoying, but willing to wait if it's worth it
			- More than 10 seconds: focus lost, users will move on to something else
		* Guidelines
			- strive for less than 100 ms
			- up to 1 second, no indicator needed
			- 1- 10 seconds, use a wait cursor
			- Over 10 seconds, complete in background

### L10: Heuristic #2: Match Between System and Real World

- The system should speak the users' language, with words, phrases and concepts familiar to the user, rather than system-oriented terms. Follow real-world conventions, making information appear in a natural and logical order.
- Why?
	+ Take advantage of users' existing *schema*
	+ Leverage perceived affordances and signifiers that suggest actions
	+ Reduce difficulty of forming effective conceptual models
- Language
- Order of operations
	+ create document -> write something -> save doc -> give it a name -> choose folder
- Metaphor
	+ shopping cart
	+ file
- The systems we create should match the real world as best as we can so that users can understand and use it effectively


[back to top](#top)

### L11: Heuristic #3: User Control and Freedom

- Users often choose system functions by mistake and will need a clearly marked "emergency exit" to leave the unwanted state without having to go through an extended dialogue. Support undo and redo
- Why?
	+ mistakes are inevitable
	+ Support the 7 stages of action by allowing reformulated goals
	+ Users employ trial and error to learn a new system
- Emergency exits:
	+ "Stop Installation"
	+ "undo" or "redo" buttons
- Users need the freedom to make mistakes and recover from their mistakes

[back to top](#top)

### L12: Heuristic #4: Consistency and Standards

- Users should not have to wonder whether different words, situations, or actions mean the same thing. Follow platform conventions.
- Why?
	+ Leverage users' schemas => allow them to use patterns of information/systems and apply that to your system
	+ present a coherent conceptual model
- Consistency of language, layout, and behavior
	+ "Search" vs. "Submit query"
	+ "Save" vs. "Commit"
	+ "Create" vs. "New..."
	+ Example: Amazon
		* different items are presented in similar ways: main picture, price on the right, description below, etc.
	+ Consistency across products
		* Think Google Docs Suite
- Platform Standards
	+ think of how poor FlatPak's website was (navigation in particular)


[back to top](#top)

### L13: Heuristic #5: Error Prevention

- Even better than good error messages is a careful design which prevents a problem from occurring in the first place. Either eliminate error-prone conditions or check for them and present users with a confirmation option before they commit to the action.
- Why?
	+ mistakes are common
	+ people don't see or read everything on the screen
	+ people make mistakes when typing, clicking, etc.
- Provide constraints
	+ ex: enter a birthdate (if you don't state the format, you could get a lot of errors)
	+ ex: live error messages as they are typing
- Confirmation of Risky Actions
	+ "Are you sure you want to permanently delete these items?"
	+ prevent errors that are likely to occur


[back to top](#top)

### L14: Heuristic #6: Recognition Over Recall

- Minimize the user's memory load by making objects, actions and options visible. The user should not have to remember information from one part of the dialogue to another. Instruction for use of the system should be visible or easily retrievable whenever appropriate.
- A familiar stimulus triggers retrieval from long-term memory
- Recall forces users to:
	+ recreate chain of associations themselves, or
	+ forcefully learn through elaborative rehearsal
- Recall will fail unless remembered actions are
	+ frequent
	+ Recent
	+ Strongly associated
- Direct Manipulation
	+ direct manipulation shows all options that we'd want to do (i.e. animate an item in a powerpoint slide)
- Where does recall come up?
	+ textual commands like in a terminal window
	+ passwords
	+ speech UI's
		* Siri gives a list of things that you can ask it / "her"

[back to top](#top)

### L15: Heuristic #7: Flexibility and Efficency of Use

- Accelerators - unseen by the novice user - may often speed up the interaction for the expert user such that the system can cater to both inexperienced and experienced users. Allow users to tailor frequent actions.
- Why?
	+ recall is bad for new/infrequent users but can be **fast** for experts
	+ Different users have different goals, allow them to customize
		* but don't force them to!
- Accelerators (i.e. keyboard shortcuts)
- Shortcuts and Bookmarks => browsers do this often

[back to top](#top)

### L16: Heuristic #8: Aesthetic and Minimalist Design

- Dialogues should not contain information that is irrelevant or rarely needed. Every extra unit of information in a dialogue competes with the relevant units of information and diminishes their relative visibility.
- Why?
	+ visual clutter makes it harder to find and focus on desired actions
	+ Good use of color, shape, motion, and gestalt principles guide the eye
	+ The more there is to see, the less of it users will actually see
- Google: nothing but a search bar
- Use Gestalt principles for non-linear reading

[back to top](#top)

### L17: Heuristic #9: Error Recovery

- Error messages should be expressed in plain language (no codes), precisely indicate the problem, and constructively suggest a solution.
- Why?
	+ #9 - is a special case of 1, 2, 3 and 5
	+ #1 - Give Feedback
	+ #2 - Speak the users' language
	+ #3 - Allow users to undo and escape mistakes
	+ #5 - Prevent and detect errors

[back to top](#top)

### L18: Heuristic #10: Help and Documentation

- Even though it is better if the system can be used without documentation, it may be necessary to provide help and documentation. Any such information should be easy to search, focused on the user's task, list concrete steps to be carried out, and not be too large.
- Why?
	+ Your UI may not be as self-explanatory as you thought
	+ Structure to support Gulf of Execution
		* easy to search
		* contain list of actions
		* focused on user's tasks
- Contextual Help
	+ help that is specific to the task they are trying to perform

### Random Items

- Look at [http://www.webpagesthatsuck.com/](http://www.webpagesthatsuck.com/); there are some great examples of bad websites

## Heuristic Evaluation and Course Wrap-up

### L19: Heuristic Evaluation

- a Heuristic Evaluation is designed to be a quick way to look at your user experience
- It is an "inspection" method where you do a systematic "close read" of your user interface and then apply the heuristics to find and explain problems
- Here is the basic methodology (very intuitive / not groundbreaking):
	+ choose a set of screens/interactions for focus
	+ step through, applying heuristics to find potential problems
	+ Write down all violations, big and small
	+ assess the severity of each problem
	+ create prioritized list of problems to fix
- Problem Severity:
	+ 1 = cosmetic, no real usability impact
	+ 2 = minor problem, fix if there is time
	+ 3 = major problem, important to fix
	+ 4 = catstophe, MUST fix
- In the example, they list a few key parts:
	+ Finding / Violation: what is the problem that you see
	+ Severity: 1 - 4
	+ Heuristic Violated: Visibility of system status
	+ Recommendation
- Prioritizing
	+ Highlight the top 5-10 problems
	+ Ranked in decreasing order of severity
	+ Use heuristics to explain WHY they matter
- he recommends getting multiple evaluators; each additional evaluator up to around 5 adds meaningful insight into the app and can find more "true" problems
- heuristic evaluation is cheap and fast; doesn't "use up" potential users
- user testing is more realistic, finds more problems, and allows you to assess other UX qualities besides just usability
- CM:
	+ if I were to do this myself, I'd need to have the 10 Heuristics on a single piece of paper with:
		* the general definition
		* key bullets breaking that down
		* examples of common items that violate this heuristic
	+ After creating the rubric, I could create a spreadsheet as he has in the example with four main boxes:
		* Description of the issue
		* System Location 
		* Heuristics Violated
		* Severity

### L20: Course Wrap-Up & Next Steps

- If UX has four components, this course has focused on the "Usability" component
	+ the other three are "Value", "Adoptability", "Desirability"
- Books:
	- Don Norman: The Design of Everyday Things
	- Jeff Johnson: Designing with the Mind in Mind
	- Steve Krug: Don't Make Me Think
* Value: Understanding User Needs
	- no magic solutions
	- UX research methods
	- Book: 
		+ Observing the User Experience
* Desirability
	- Emotion Design
		- Book:
			+ Don Normal: Emotional Design
		- Three levels of emotional response
			+ visceral - fast, primitve
			+ behavioral - based on use
			+ reflective - based on associations
+ Aesthetics and Experience
	* Experience is an "inseparable, meaningful whole"
	* experience becomes relevant through remembered stories
	* there's more to experience than product features
	* recommended article
		- [User Experience and Experience Design](https://www.interaction-design.org/literature/book/the-encyclopedia-of-human-computer-interaction-2nd-ed/user-experience-and-experience-design)

	* Book: 
		- Service Design
	* products vs relationships
	* the "customer journey"
	* multiple "touchpoints"

		- big area, worthy of its own course
		- even the subfield of web accessibility is big and evolving.
		- [World Wide Access: Accessible Web Design](http://www.washington.edu/doit/videos/index.php?vid=35)
+ Designing for Humans
	* understand perception and cofnition
	* understand design principles for usable systems
