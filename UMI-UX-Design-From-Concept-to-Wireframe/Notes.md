## Course Syllabus and Learning Objectives

- By the end of this course, learners will be able to:
	+ Explain how designers approach complex problems
	+ Describe the iterative nature of the design process and its main components
	+ Recognize the central role of ideation and gain experience in sketching
	+ Create personas, scenarios, and storyboards
	+ Evaluate systematically tradeoffs of alternative ways you can design a component of a system
- Design is a skill not just "knowledge"; you get better at design **by designing**.

## Introduction to the Design Process

### L1: What is Design?

- Wicked problems...
	+ are ill-defined / underspecified
	+ don't have a right or wrong solution
	+ are context-dependent
	+ Don't have a clear test for solutions
- "Design is how it works" - Steve Jobs 
- "Design is a plan for arranging elements in such a way as to best accomplish a particular purpose." - Charles Eames
- **Purpose:** what is the function of this object?
- "...every design problems begins with an effort to achieve fitness between two entities: the form in question and its context" - Christopher Alexander
- **Context:** in what situations does this thing intend to be used?
- **Constraints:** what determines how this thing can be made and used?
- Design is about creating things that fulfill their purpose well while adhering to constraints
- Core design skills
	+ to frame, or reframe, the problem and the objective
	+ to create and envision alternatives
	+ to select from those alternatives
		* articulate trade-offs of other solutions, etc.
	+ to visualize and prototype the intended solution
	+ to synthesize a solution that brings all those together
- **Interaction design** applies design skills to the creation of interfaces for computational artifacts
