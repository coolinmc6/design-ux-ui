## Course Summary and Key Take-aways

### Course Summary

- [Framing Design Problems](https://github.com/coolinmc6/design-ux-ui/blob/master/UMI-UX-Design-From-Concept-to-Wireframe/Notes.md#l3-framing-design-problems)
	+ a design frame is what the designer considers important and will focus on when doing the work / solving the design problem
	+ There are two main items that must be kept in mind:
		* **Scope**: How big is the problem you are focusing?
			- is this a complete change of the previous "system" or are you fixing one aspect?
		* **Design Space**: What can vary in how you are thinking about the problem?
			- what are the variables that can change per type of user or solution?

### My Key Takeaways

## Course Syllabus and Learning Objectives

- By the end of this course, learners will be able to:
	+ Explain how designers approach complex problems
	+ Describe the iterative nature of the design process and its main components
	+ Recognize the central role of ideation and gain experience in sketching
	+ Create personas, scenarios, and storyboards
	+ Evaluate systematically tradeoffs of alternative ways you can design a component of a system
- Design is a skill not just "knowledge"; you get better at design **by designing**.

## Introduction to the Design Process

### L1: What is Design?

- Wicked problems...
	+ are ill-defined / underspecified
	+ don't have a right or wrong solution
	+ are context-dependent
	+ Don't have a clear test for solutions
- "Design is how it works" - Steve Jobs 
- "Design is a plan for arranging elements in such a way as to best accomplish a particular purpose." - Charles Eames
- **Purpose:** what is the function of this object?
- "...every design problems begins with an effort to achieve fitness between two entities: the form in question and its context" - Christopher Alexander
- **Context:** in what situations does this thing intend to be used?
- **Constraints:** what determines how this thing can be made and used?
- Design is about creating things that fulfill their purpose well while adhering to constraints
- Core design skills
	+ to frame, or reframe, the problem and the objective
	+ to create and envision alternatives
	+ to select from those alternatives
		* articulate trade-offs of other solutions, etc.
	+ to visualize and prototype the intended solution
	+ to synthesize a solution that brings all those together
- **Interaction design** applies design skills to the creation of interfaces for computational artifacts

### L2: Design Process - An Overview

- Design is not just creative genius; design is a process
- Design Process (In a Nutshell)

![Design in a nutshell](https://github.com/coolinmc6/design-ux-ui/blob/master/UMI-UX-Design-From-Concept-to-Wireframe/Course-Documents/design-in-nutshell.png)

- Design is an iterative process and it is messy! Get comfortable with ambiguity

### L3: Framing Design Problems

- **goal:** formulate the problem and understand important constraints a solution needs to satisfy
- A frame is an active perspective that both describes and perpetually changes the situation
- Frame describes aspects of the design problem the designer considers to be important and will focus on
	+ you are trying to learn what's in and what's out
	+ Weight Loss App example
		* which will behaviors will target?
		* Who is the population?
		* Would this be time-limited or ongoing?
- **Scope**: How big is the problem oyu are trying to focus on
	+ Weight Loss App
		* Affect all behaviors?
		* Comprehensive weight loss support or just one part of it?
- **Design Space**: what can vary in how you are thinking about the problem?
	+ Weight Loss App:
		* population
		* level of motivational readiness
		* weight-loss behaviors
		* situations where the system is used
		* types of technology
- No design problem exists fully formed. A key job a designer is to specify the exact problem that needs to be solved
	- Problem framing is an **iterative process**
		- project timeline changes, budget gets cut, designer's understanding of the problem changes
