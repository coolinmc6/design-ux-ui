## Course Summary and Key Take-aways

### Course Summary

- The course opens with several definitions of design highlighting one of biggest misconceptions about design that it is NOT just what it looks like. There are several [design quotes](#design-quotes) worth taking a look at
- There are three main parts of designing anything that you must understand:
	+ Purpose: what is the function of the object?
	+ Context: in what situations will it be used?
	+ Constraints: what determines how this thing can be made and used?
- I also really like the [core design skills](#core-design-skills) as a good framework for what a designer should be able to do
	+ **TASK:** create a toolkit around these skills. What tools have I learned (i.e. brainstorming, sketching, etc.) that can help in each of these? Lecture 2 has a great breakdown of those items [here](#design-in-a-nutshell)
- Lecture 2 shows all those items (pretty much as I want it per the task above) and reiterates a lesson I've heard in all of these lectures is that **design is iterative**. It is messy and ambiguous and you have to get used to that
- [Framing Design Problems](https://github.com/coolinmc6/design-ux-ui/blob/master/UMI-UX-Design-From-Concept-to-Wireframe/Notes.md#l3-framing-design-problems)
	+ a design frame is what the designer considers important and will focus on when doing the work / solving the design problem
	+ There are two main items that must be kept in mind:
		* **Scope**: How big is the problem you are focusing?
			- is this a complete change of the previous "system" or are you fixing one aspect?
		* **Design Space**: What can vary in how you are thinking about the problem?
			- what are the variables that can change per type of user or solution?
- [Formative Research](https://github.com/coolinmc6/design-ux-ui/blob/master/UMI-UX-Design-From-Concept-to-Wireframe/Notes.md#l4-formative-research) discusses how to research. It's another good list of **all** the methods used to learn about user needs, both formal and informal.
- The [Ideation](#l5-introdution-to-ideation) lecture had a good explanation and introduction to the main methods of coming up with ideas. The notes on [sketching](#l6-sketching) were good and probably something I should do more but I really liked seeing IDEO's [Rules for Brainstorming](#rules-for-brainstorming) and should keep them in mind for this toolkit
- I've read about [Personas](https://github.com/coolinmc6/design-ux-ui/blob/master/UMI-UX-Design-From-Concept-to-Wireframe/Notes.md#l8-personas) and I would probably benefit from re-reading my notes on this. They make sense on paper but would like to do more with them.
- [Scenarios](#l9-scenarios) and [Storyboards](#l10-storyboards) are different means to the same end. Storyboards provide a bit more physical context and might paint a fuller picture but it sounds like only one or the other is employed in the design process, not both.

## Course Syllabus and Learning Objectives

- By the end of this course, learners will be able to:
	+ Explain how designers approach complex problems
	+ Describe the iterative nature of the design process and its main components
	+ Recognize the central role of ideation and gain experience in sketching
	+ Create personas, scenarios, and storyboards
	+ Evaluate systematically tradeoffs of alternative ways you can design a component of a system
- Design is a skill not just "knowledge"; you get better at design **by designing**.

## Introduction to the Design Process

### L1: What is Design?

- Wicked problems...
	+ are ill-defined / underspecified
	+ don't have a right or wrong solution
	+ are context-dependent
	+ Don't have a clear test for solutions
- <a name="design-quotes"></a>"Design is how it works" - Steve Jobs 
- "Design is a plan for arranging elements in such a way as to best accomplish a particular purpose." - Charles Eames
- **Purpose:** what is the function of this object?
- "...every design problems begins with an effort to achieve fitness between two entities: the form in question and its context" - Christopher Alexander
- **Context:** in what situations does this thing intend to be used?
- **Constraints:** what determines how this thing can be made and used?
- Design is about creating things that fulfill their purpose well while adhering to constraints
- <a name="core-design-skills">Core design skills</a>
	+ to frame, or reframe, the problem and the objective
	+ to create and envision alternatives
	+ to select from those alternatives
		* articulate trade-offs of other solutions, etc.
	+ to visualize and prototype the intended solution
	+ to synthesize a solution that brings all those together
- **Interaction design** applies design skills to the creation of interfaces for computational artifacts

### L2: Design Process - An Overview

- Design is not just creative genius; design is a process
- Design Process (In a Nutshell)

<a name="design-in-a-nutshell"></a>

![Design in a nutshell](https://github.com/coolinmc6/design-ux-ui/blob/master/UMI-UX-Design-From-Concept-to-Wireframe/Course-Documents/design-in-nutshell.png)

- Design is an iterative process and it is messy! Get comfortable with ambiguity

[back to top](#top)

### L3: Framing Design Problems

- **goal:** formulate the problem and understand important constraints a solution needs to satisfy
- A frame is an active perspective that both describes and perpetually changes the situation
- Frame describes aspects of the design problem the designer considers to be important and will focus on
	+ you are trying to learn what's in and what's out
	+ Weight Loss App example
		* which will behaviors will target?
		* Who is the population?
		* Would this be time-limited or ongoing?
- **Scope**: How big is the problem you are trying to focus on?
	+ Weight Loss App
		* Affect all behaviors?
		* Comprehensive weight loss support or just one part of it?
- **Design Space**: what can vary in how you are thinking about the problem?
	+ More narrowly defined: 
	
> the **design space** is the range of alternative ways that a design solution can work. **Design space** refers to the dimensions on which a design solution can vary: size, complexity, intended population, etc. 


	- Designers use the notion of the design space to articulate classes of design solutions they should consider and the tradeoffs they should analyze.
	+ Weight Loss App:
		* population
		* level of motivational readiness
		* weight-loss behaviors
		* situations where the system is used
		* types of technology
- No design problem exists fully formed. A key job a designer is to specify the exact problem that needs to be solved
	- Problem framing is an **iterative process**
		- project timeline changes, budget gets cut, designer's understanding of the problem changes

### L4: Formative Research

- **Goals:** 
	+ understand the existing context and domain
	+ identify targets for design improvements
- Methods: formal and informal
	+ Formal Methods
		* interviews
		* surveys
		* participatory design grouops
		* systematic observations
		* shadowing
		* task analytsis
		* process mapping
		* etc.
	+ Formal Methods are:
		* effective and data-rich
		* slow
	+ Informal Methods
		* informal observations
		* targeted conversations with key stakeholders
		* Foraging on information about the domain
		* Asking social network for bug lists
	+ Informal methods
		* tend to be quick, cheap, but you can miss important aspects of the problem (unless you are very good)
- Whichever trajectory
	+ collect a lot of stuff
	+ put your materials together
	+ immerse yourself in them
- Finding Inspiration
	+ "Nothing is original. Steal from anywhere that resonates with inspiration or fuels your imagination."
	+ take notes and sketch
- Bug List
	+ find examples of other technologies that address your problem
	+ Try them
	+ Compile list of frictions and frustrations that you discover in those tools
	+ Come up with ways of addressing those limitations
- Other Sources of Inspiration
	+ Tech that solves a related problem
	+ Non-tech solutions for your problem
	+ Your population's context, habits, culture, infrastructure
	+ Elegant artefacts and processes
	+ Anything else that strikes your fancy!

### Quiz 1:

- Design is "compromise":
	+ The issue is not that designers do low-quality work. It’s that most real-world design problems are complex enough that they often involve conflicting constraints — constraints that pull the design solution in different directions. A designer has to balance those conflicting demands, and this balancing usually means that some aspects of the design end up being done in a way that the designer wouldn’t have chosen if the constraints were not present.

## Ideation

### L5: Introdution to Ideation

- **Goal:** Generate a lot of concepts from which you can generate a high-quality solution
	+ large body of evidence showing that you if you start with a large set of different ideas, the final product is better
- Basic Rules of Ideation
	+ Make ideas cheap!	
		* generate ideas as quickly as possible which ALLOWS us to quickly throw them away as well
		* fill in just enough details to get a sense of the idea
	+ Generate both variations of an idea and very different ideas
	+ Don't worry about idea quality or feasibility
- **Ideation Outcome:** dozens or even hundreds of ideas
- Tools for Ideation
	+ sketching
	+ Brainstorming
	+ Mindmapping
		* concept is put in center of sheet
	+ Timed idea generation (generate as many ideas as possible)
	+ Generate a minimum of X ideas (i.e. 40)
	+ The goal of this is to visualize and think about the problem in many different ways and you can use a number of tools to do that

[back to top](#top)

### L6: Sketching

- "Sketching is not only the archetypal activity of design. It has been thus for centuries."
- Sketching is about generating and communicating ideas
- Sketch Attributes
	+ **quick**
	+ timely
	+ **inexpensive**
	+ disposable
	+ plentiful
	+ clear vocabulary
	+ distinct gesture
	+ **minimal details**
	+ appropriate level of refinement
	+ suggest and explore
	+ ambiguity
- Sketches don't have to be beautiful to be useful
- Sketch vs. Prototype Summary:

![Sketch vs. Prototype Summary](https://github.com/coolinmc6/design-ux-ui/blob/master/UMI-UX-Design-From-Concept-to-Wireframe/Course-Documents/sketching-vs-prototype.png)

- There are many different types of sketches
	+ some are just for communicating sketch
	+ **thinking sketches generate large numbers of ideas**
	+ technical sketches are used in engineering
	+ Presentation sketches have more polish
	+ Emotive sketch are designed to be later stages of design
- Recommends getting a design notebook

### L7: Brainstorming

- <a name="rules-for-brainstorming">IDEO Rules for Brainstorming</a>
	+ Have a clear problem statement
	+ Have clear rules (i.e. go for quantity)
	+ Number the ideas
	+ Build on ideas
	+ Make ideas visible
	+ Get physical (sketch, mind-map, make, act out)
- Traps to Avoid
	+ criticizing ideas; 
		+ Rule: don't criticize ideas, every idea is valid
	+ Taking turns (or trying to make the process less messy)
		* Rule: let it be a bit chaotic, have people jump in when they have an idea
	+ Getting sucked into developing an idea in depth
		* Rule: don't go too far down one idea
	+ Going too far on tangent
		* Rule: don't go off-topic / off-scope
	+ Stopping to do research
		* Rule: keep going for more ideas
- How to Keep Moving
	+ Brainstorm solutions to pain points
	+ Determine steps in process, brainstorm on those
	+ Identify loci for innovation
	+ Identify solutions for different users
	+ Have a facilitator
- Brainstorming Facilitator
	+ Make sure people don't go on excessive tangents
	+ Notice when session participants feel stuck or have hit a dead end, redirect session by bringing up a new topic
	+ To keep in check the critiquing of ideas
	+ Prevent participants from diving too deeply into the ideas
- Rapid Brainstorming with Structure Example
	+ I. Brainstorm a list of 10 objects associated with snow and cold weather
		* write these objects along the top of a large piece of paper
	+ II. Brainstorm 10 controls or techniques for controlling those objects
		* Write these objects along the left side of the paper
	+ Populate as much of the matrix as you can in 10 minutes
	+ Don't worry about whether the idea is good or not
- Reward yourself after brainstorming; it's very hard

## Design Constraints and Making Choices

### L8: Personas

- The purpose of personas is to build concrete image of users that designers can design toward
- They are based on all the research, skecthing, conversations, etc.
- Personas are fictional characters that represent key types of technology's intended users that were discovered through formative work.
- Key Characteristics of Personas
	+ Based on data
		* they are based on formative research
	+ Embody goals, traits, behaviors and context that could influence if and how the technology is used
	+ Represent distinct classes of intended users
- Persona Example
	+ Picture
	+ Demographics: age, occupation, location, life stage (married? children?)
	+ Goals and Motivators
		+ goals related to technology and motivators the could be leveraged or act as barriers
		* career-oriented? being a parent? novelty (unique about her), etc.
	+ Behaviors and Constraints
		* routines an dother behaviors (e.g. work practices) that create opportunities or barriers for technology
		* weather? access to technology? personal traits (i.e. need structure / routine), hectic schedule?
	+ Context
		* living and working environments and other aspects of physical and social context that may affect technology use
- You would be constantly checking your design ideas to ask: would this work for this Mary? Would this work for John?
- Benefits of Personas
	+ personalize and summarize a lot of data
	+ Provide a mental shortcut for design considerations
	+ Allow discussion of and agreement on who intended users are
	+ Easy to understand by non-designers
	+ Help check tendencies to design for oneself or the "elastic user"
- Some final considerations
	+ personas should feel "real" - they should accurately summarize available data
	+ They should focus on common rather than idiosyncratic traits/characteristics
	+ Content should be relevant
		* family situation might not be relevant for design of a workplace technology

### L9: Scenarios

- Scenarios are short stories about specific users who are using technology being designed to accomplish specific goals in a specific context
- Scenarios bridge findings about user needs and ideas about how a technology may support those needs
- Why use scenarios?
	+ support reflection during the design process
	+ open-ended and easily revised
	+ anchor design discussion
- Elements of a Scenario:
	+ **Setting**: situation (state of the system, context of use) in which activity occurs
	+ **Agent**(s): people performing the activity described in the scenario
	+ **Goals**: objectives agents are trying to accomplish
	+ **Actions**: activities that agents do to accomplish their goals
	+ **Events**: things that happen to users while doing the activities in the scenario
- Types of Scenarios
	+ problem scenarios: describe features of the current situation
		* the users' current problem and what they are trying to accomplish
	+ goal or task-based scenarios: what the user wants to do
	+ activity scenarios: transformt he current practice into new design features
	+ full scale task scenarios: steps to accomplish a task
	+ information scenarios: how users perceive, interpret and make sense of information
	+ interaction scenarios: physical actions and system responses that respond to users' tasks
	+ When to use
		* problem scenarios are typically done first to understand the problem they are trying to sovle
- Some final considerations
	+ you don't need to be a great writer; provide enough detail to understand the scenario
	+ scenarios should be quick; more rough scenarios
	+ scenarios are process artifacts. Do only as much as is helpful
	+ scenarios can help uncover unwanted technology effects


[back to top](#top)

### L10: Storyboards

- A storyboard is a series of sketches that visually conveys how a user engages in an activity that involves the technology that is being developed.
- Why storyboards (if you have scenarios)?
	+ they help you think more deeply about:
		* environments where the system is used
		* physical constraints
		* user's motivation and emotion
		* relationships among multiple people
- Elements of a Storyboard
	+ Zoom: how wide/narrow is the focus of the frame?
	+ Angle: from whose point of view is the content in the frame? User's? Observer's?
	+ Detail: what is the frame focused on?
	+ Emotion: what emotion is the user expressing?
	+ Setting: Where does the action take place?
- Storyboarding considerations
	+ How many panels are needed?
	+ What interactions will be represented?
	+ How will time be represented?
	+ How will the user ("character") fit?
	+ What text will be used?
- Some final thoughts
	+ You don't need to be a great artist to draw useful storboards
	+ storyboarding quickly allows you create more storyboards
	+ storyboards most helpful for conveying physical environment, emotion, and relationships
	+ Play to your strengths - often either a scenario OR a storyboard will work

### L11: Design Rationale

- Design rationale is articulation and analysis of tradeoffs of different alternatives to guide design
- Goals: to understand the design options, their pros and cons, and to make principled decisions about which design options to pursue
- Questions, Options, Criteria
	+ A feature is represented by multiple possible options which answer a particular question
	+ Criteria help articulate their tradeoffs and guide the choice of which option(s) to go with
- Questions:
	+ provide structure to the design space
	+ Help uncover and define alternatives
- Options
	+ Different potential design answers to the same question
		* e.g. How should consumed food be entered into the food log?
- Criteria
	+ Required and desirable properties the design should satisfy
	+ Differ in importance and generality
	+ Help determine reasons for decisions
- Sources of Criteria
	+ Formative work with target users
	+ Usability broadly construed
		* integration with daily routines, privacy, social acceptability, user expectations, etc.
	+ Previous studies
	+ Behaviorial studies
	+ Requirements from other parts of the design
- Things to Consider
	+ There might not be one clear answer
	+ It's important to know the most important criteria
	+ A design decision can affect many other aspects of the project
	+ Empirical data (from surveys, focus groups, small studies) can inform design decisions
- SUmmary
	+ deciding which option to pursue is a key design activity
	+ design decisions need to be intentional and reasoned
	+ QOC (Question-Option-Criteria) enables designers to make decisions in a systematic way
