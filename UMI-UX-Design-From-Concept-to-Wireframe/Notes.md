## Course Summary and Key Take-aways

### Course Summary

- [Framing Design Problems](https://github.com/coolinmc6/design-ux-ui/blob/master/UMI-UX-Design-From-Concept-to-Wireframe/Notes.md#l3-framing-design-problems)
	+ a design frame is what the designer considers important and will focus on when doing the work / solving the design problem
	+ There are two main items that must be kept in mind:
		* **Scope**: How big is the problem you are focusing?
			- is this a complete change of the previous "system" or are you fixing one aspect?
		* **Design Space**: What can vary in how you are thinking about the problem?
			- what are the variables that can change per type of user or solution?

### My Key Takeaways

## Course Syllabus and Learning Objectives

- By the end of this course, learners will be able to:
	+ Explain how designers approach complex problems
	+ Describe the iterative nature of the design process and its main components
	+ Recognize the central role of ideation and gain experience in sketching
	+ Create personas, scenarios, and storyboards
	+ Evaluate systematically tradeoffs of alternative ways you can design a component of a system
- Design is a skill not just "knowledge"; you get better at design **by designing**.

## Introduction to the Design Process

### L1: What is Design?

- Wicked problems...
	+ are ill-defined / underspecified
	+ don't have a right or wrong solution
	+ are context-dependent
	+ Don't have a clear test for solutions
- "Design is how it works" - Steve Jobs 
- "Design is a plan for arranging elements in such a way as to best accomplish a particular purpose." - Charles Eames
- **Purpose:** what is the function of this object?
- "...every design problems begins with an effort to achieve fitness between two entities: the form in question and its context" - Christopher Alexander
- **Context:** in what situations does this thing intend to be used?
- **Constraints:** what determines how this thing can be made and used?
- Design is about creating things that fulfill their purpose well while adhering to constraints
- Core design skills
	+ to frame, or reframe, the problem and the objective
	+ to create and envision alternatives
	+ to select from those alternatives
		* articulate trade-offs of other solutions, etc.
	+ to visualize and prototype the intended solution
	+ to synthesize a solution that brings all those together
- **Interaction design** applies design skills to the creation of interfaces for computational artifacts

### L2: Design Process - An Overview

- Design is not just creative genius; design is a process
- Design Process (In a Nutshell)

![Design in a nutshell](https://github.com/coolinmc6/design-ux-ui/blob/master/UMI-UX-Design-From-Concept-to-Wireframe/Course-Documents/design-in-nutshell.png)

- Design is an iterative process and it is messy! Get comfortable with ambiguity

### L3: Framing Design Problems

- **goal:** formulate the problem and understand important constraints a solution needs to satisfy
- A frame is an active perspective that both describes and perpetually changes the situation
- Frame describes aspects of the design problem the designer considers to be important and will focus on
	+ you are trying to learn what's in and what's out
	+ Weight Loss App example
		* which will behaviors will target?
		* Who is the population?
		* Would this be time-limited or ongoing?
- **Scope**: How big is the problem oyu are trying to focus on
	+ Weight Loss App
		* Affect all behaviors?
		* Comprehensive weight loss support or just one part of it?
- **Design Space**: what can vary in how you are thinking about the problem?
	+ More narrowly defined: the **design space** is the range of alternative ways that a design solution can work. **Design space** refers to the dimensions on which a design solution can vary: size, complexity, intended population, etc. Designers use the notion of the design space to articulate classes of design solutions they should consider and the tradeoffs they should analyze.
	+ Weight Loss App:
		* population
		* level of motivational readiness
		* weight-loss behaviors
		* situations where the system is used
		* types of technology
- No design problem exists fully formed. A key job a designer is to specify the exact problem that needs to be solved
	- Problem framing is an **iterative process**
		- project timeline changes, budget gets cut, designer's understanding of the problem changes

### L4: Formative Research

- **Goals:* 
	+ understand the existing context and domain
	+ identify targets for design improvements
- Methods: formal and informal
	+ Formal Methods
		* interviews
		* surveys
		* participatory design grouops
		* systematic observations
		* shadowing
		* task analytsis
		* process mapping
		* etc.
	+ Formal Methods are:
		* effective and data-rich
		* slow
	+ Informal Methods
		* informal observations
		* targeted conversations with key stakeholders
		* Foraging on information about the domain
		* Asking social network for bug lists
	+ Informal methods
		* tend to be quick, cheap, but you can miss important aspects of the problem (unless you are very good)
- Whichever trajectory
	+ collect a lot of stuff
	+ put your materials together
	+ immerse yourself in them
- Finding Inspiration
	+ "Nothing is original. Steal from anywhere that resonates with inspiration or fuels your imagination."
	+ take notes and sketch
- Bug List
	+ find examples of other technologies that address your problem
	+ Try them
	+ Compile list of frictions and frustrations that you discover in those tools
	+ Come up with ways of addressing those limitations
- Other Sources of Inspiration
	+ Tech that solves a related problem
	+ Non-tech solutions for your problem
	+ Your population's context, habits, culture, infrastructure
	+ Elegant artefacts and processes
	+ Anything else that strikes your fancy!

### Quiz 1:

- Design is "compromise":
	+ The issue is not that designers do low-quality work. It’s that most real-world design problems are complex enough that they often involve conflicting constraints — constraints that pull the design solution in different directions. A designer has to balance those conflicting demands, and this balancing usually means that some aspects of the design end up being done in a way that the designer wouldn’t have chosen if the constraints were not present.

## Ideation

### L5: Introdution to Ideation

- **Goal:** Generate a lot of concepts from which you can generate a high-quality solution
	+ large body of evidence showing that you if you start with a large set of different ideas, the final product is better
- Basic Rules of Ideation
	+ Make ideas cheap!	
		* generate ideas as quickly as possible which ALLOWS us to quickly throw them away as well
		* fill in just enough details to get a sense of the idea
	+ Generate both variations of an idea and very different ideas
	+ Don't worry about idea quality or feasibility
- **Ideation Outcome:** dozens or even hundreds of ideas
- Tools for Ideation
	+ sketching
	+ Brainstorming
	+ Mindmapping
		* concept is put in center of sheet
	+ Timed idea generation (generate as many ideas as possible)
	+ Generate a minimum of X ideas (i.e. 40)
	+ The goal of this is to visualize and think about the problem in many different ways and you can use a number of tools to do that

### L6: Sketching

- "Sketching is not only the archetypal activity of design. It has been thus for centuries."
- Sketching is about generating and communicating ideas
- Sketch Attributes
	+ **quick**
	+ timely
	+ **inexpensive**
	+ disposable
	+ plentiful
	+ clear vocabulary
	+ distinct gesture
	+ **minimal details**
	+ appropriate level of refinement
	+ suggest and explore
	+ ambiguity
- Sketches don't have to be beautiful to be useful
- Sketch vs. Prototype Summary:

![Sketch vs. Prototype Summary](https://github.com/coolinmc6/design-ux-ui/blob/master/UMI-UX-Design-From-Concept-to-Wireframe/Course-Documents/sketching-vs-prototype.png)

- There are many different types of sketches
	+ some are just for communicating sketch
	+ **thinking sketch generate large number of ideas**
	+ technical sketches are used in engineering
	+ Presentation sketches have more polish
	+ Emotive sketch are designed to be later stages of design
- Recommends getting a design notebook
