# Introduction to User Experience



## Part 1: What is UX? What are UX Research and Design?

### L1: What is User Experience?

- What is Good UX?
	+ usefule
	+ helpful
	+ easy to learn
	+ accessible
	+ attractive
	+ fun
	+ connected
	+ delightful
- What is a Bad UX?
	+ Stressful
	+ Confusing
	+ Ugly
	+ Distracting
	+ Inefficient
	+ Tedious
	+ Condescending
	+ Inconsiderate
	+ Frustrating
- Why does it matter?
	+ A successful experience is the overlap of "what users want to do" and "what you want your users to do"
- The Whole User Experience
	+ UX = the experience people have when they interact with your product
		* using the product
		* choosing the product
		* acquiring the product
		* learning how to use the product
		* fixing the product
		* upgrading the product
		* etc.
- Why is UX hard?
	+ You are not the user?
		* you don't represent ALL users
	+ Computers are *weird*
		* translating what is easy for computers into something that is easy for humans
	+ Software is (usually) complex
- How to Make UX Easy
	+ Follow an interative prototyping process
	+ Apply user-centered research and design methods
	+ Understand a bit about human behavior
	+ Apply common sense

### L2: The UX Process

- How to Make UX Easy
	+ Follow an interative prototyping process
	+ Apply user-centered research and design methods
	+ Understand a bit about human behavior
	+ Apply common sense
- Fail Fast
	+ you won't get it right 
	+ get it wrong quickly and as often as possilbe
+ Assess => Design => Build => Assess (again) and so on
	* circular
	- the "Spiral Model" 
	- UX Research in the "Assess" phase
	- UX Design in the "Design" phase
* Key Methods: UX Research
	- Interviews
	- Observations
	- Surveys
	- User Testing
	- Inspection Methods
* Key Methods: UX Design
	- Personas, Scenarios, User Stories
	- Sketching and Ideation
	- Storyboarding
	- Mapping and Navigation Design
	- Comparative Research
	- Lo-, Mid-, and Hi-Fidelity Prototyping
* Understand How People Work
	- What can people perceive?
		+ how do they extract information from visual stimuli
	- How do people do things?
	- How does emotion play a role?
* Common Sense

### L3: Components of UX

- Good and Bad UX
- Components of UX
	+ Value, Usability, Adoptability, Desirability
	+ Value
	+ Usability
		* can users do what they need to do?
	+ Desirability
		* Is it fun, attractive and pleasant to use?
	+ Adoptability
		* How easy is it to start using the device?
		* example: DuoLingo => start learning right away.
- Assessing UX: Questions
	+ Value
		* What do users need?
		* Does this design fulfill the need?
	+ Usability
		* How do they do it now?
- UX is not just about usability, attractiveness, etc.
- Let the process be your guide; ask questions and iterate
- **Homework:**
	+ Discuss 1 example of good UX and 1 example of bad UX. Answer these questions:
		+ What was your goal of using the interface?
		+ What action did you intend to perform?
		+ What features of the interface made it easy or difficult to perform the action?
		+ How would you make it better if it was a bad design?
