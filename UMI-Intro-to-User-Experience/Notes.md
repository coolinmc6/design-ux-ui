## Part 1: What is UX? What are UX Research and Design?

### L1: What is User Experience?

- What is Good UX?
	+ usefule
	+ helpful
	+ easy to learn
	+ accessible
	+ attractive
	+ fun
	+ connected
	+ delightful
- What is a Bad UX?
	+ Stressful
	+ Confusing
	+ Ugly
	+ Distracting
	+ Inefficient
	+ Tedious
	+ Condescending
	+ Inconsiderate
	+ Frustrating
- Why does it matter?
	+ A successful experience is the overlap of "what users want to do" and "what you want your users to do"
- The Whole User Experience
	+ UX = the experience people have when they interact with your product
		* using the product
		* choosing the product
		* acquiring the product
		* learning how to use the product
		* fixing the product
		* upgrading the product
		* etc.
- Why is UX hard?
	+ You are not the user?
		* you don't represent ALL users
	+ Computers are *weird*
		* translating what is easy for computers into something that is easy for humans
	+ Software is (usually) complex
- How to Make UX Easy
	+ Follow an interative prototyping process
	+ Apply user-centered research and design methods
	+ Understand a bit about human behavior
	+ Apply common sense

[back to top](#top)

### L2: The UX Process

- How to Make UX Easy
	+ Follow an interative prototyping process
	+ Apply user-centered research and design methods
	+ Understand a bit about human behavior
	+ Apply common sense
- Fail Fast
	+ you won't get it right 
	+ get it wrong quickly and as often as possilbe
+ Assess => Design => Build => Assess (again) and so on
	* circular
	- the "Spiral Model" 
	- UX Research in the "Assess" phase
	- UX Design in the "Design" phase
* Key Methods: UX Research
	- Interviews
	- Observations
	- Surveys
	- User Testing
	- Inspection Methods
* Key Methods: UX Design
	- Personas, Scenarios, User Stories
	- Sketching and Ideation
	- Storyboarding
	- Mapping and Navigation Design
	- Comparative Research
	- Lo-, Mid-, and Hi-Fidelity Prototyping
* Understand How People Work
	- What can people perceive?
		+ how do they extract information from visual stimuli
	- How do people do things?
	- How does emotion play a role?
* Common Sense

[back to top](#top)

### L3: Components of UX

- Good and Bad UX
- Components of UX
	+ Value, Usability, Adoptability, Desirability
	+ Value
	+ Usability
		* can users do what they need to do?
	+ Desirability
		* Is it fun, attractive and pleasant to use?
	+ Adoptability
		* How easy is it to start using the device?
		* example: DuoLingo => start learning right away.
- Assessing UX: Questions
	+ Value
		* What do users need?
		* Does this design fulfill the need?
	+ Usability
		* How do they do it now?
- UX is not just about usability, attractiveness, etc.
- Let the process be your guide; ask questions and iterate
- **Homework:**
	+ Discuss 1 example of good UX and 1 example of bad UX. Answer these questions:
		+ What was your goal of using the interface?
		+ What action did you intend to perform?
		+ What features of the interface made it easy or difficult to perform the action?
		+ How would you make it better if it was a bad design?

## Part 2: UX Research Overview - Part 1

### L4: Basic Methods of UX Research

- Three basic methods of UX Research
	+ Ask
	+ Observe
	+ Inspect
- Ask
	+ interviews
	+ surveys
		* questions distributed to focus groups, diary studies, experience sampling
- Observe
	+ Ethnographic obsesrvations
	+ User testing
		* ask them to perform specific tasks to see how they use the product
	+ Usage Analytics
		* analyze large scale traces of system usage
- Inspection Methods
	+ guideline-based
	+ Walkthroughs
	+ Comparative Analysis
- Combo: Watch and Ask
	+ User testing
	+ Contextual Interviews
		* ask questions while observing "natural" activities
- When to use What?
	+ Ask when:
		* observation is infeasible (infrequent, long, private)
		* values and motivations are key
		* (Surveys) Large numbers and high certainty are needed
	+ Observer when:
		* Self-report will miss information (memory, tacit knowledge)
		* Process and communication are important
		* (Analytics) Large numbres and high certainty are needed
	+ Inspect when:
		* you have a product to inspect

### L5: User Testing, Part 1

- What is User Testing
	+ Watch representative users try to accomplish importants tasks using a product
	+ AKA "usability testing" 
- Why User Testing?
	+ You learn a LOT from watching people use a system
		* What works and what doesn't
		* Why things work and don't
		* User needs you missed
	+ Why not just use your own experience?
		* You know too much about the sytem, AND...
		* You know too little the users and their thinking
- Basic Idea
	+ Find potential users
	+ Ask them to do some stuff
	+ Observe
	+ Ask some questions (debrief)
	+ Write down what you learned
- Potential Users
	+ People who fall within the target audience
		* attitudes
		* behaviors
		* characteristics
	+ NOT current users
		* OK if current users of the system but not for selected tasks
- Tasks (what you ask them to do)
	+ i.e. for Amazon
		* buy a coffee maker
		* write a book review
- Choosing tasks
	+ pick taks that most users need to do
	+ Close-ended tasks
		* have a clear end point
		* have a verifiable outcome
		* Often has an expected path
	+ Open-ended Tasks
		* Allow user to judge when complete
		* May not be verifiable
		* Allow following alternate paths
		* Examples:
			- find some books that you might like to read on vacation
			- CM: find some skills that you'd like to learn
+ Which are Better?
	* Close-Ended
		- less natural
		- control for motivation
		- control for interpretation
		- Assess for success
	* Open-Ended
		- More natural
		- varying motivation
		- Varying interpretation
		- Success is unknown
	* You can use both!! 
	* Maybe use close-ended tasks initially to see that people can use it
+ Task Sets
	* Progress from easier to harder
	* Cover a range of critical task types (browse, search, buy)
	* Can include open and close-ended tasks
	* be careful to avoid "ordering effects"
		- if your tasks are set in a sequential or quasi-sequential order, they'd have help doing something that they normally wouldn't have
	* 


### L6: User Testing, Part 2

- Task Wording
	+ don't lead the witness
		* Not good: "Put three books in your shopping cart and buy them using standard shipping"
		* Better: "Choose three books and buy them"
	+ Avoid ambiguity
		* Not good: "Use a list to find a gift for your 10-year old nephew"
		* Better: "A friend told you about Amazon's list feature. Use an Amazon list"
	+ Include context and motivation
		* Not good: "Buy a book and have it shipped by Monday"
		* Better: "Colleagues from Japan are coming into town and you need a book on Japanese business practices by Monday to brush up on business etiquette"
	+ Pilot Test
		* it's very hard to get right on the first try
		* Try the tasks out
			- Yourself!!
			- with a friend or two
- Think Aloud
	+ participants to say (out loud) what they are thinking
	+ Thinking includes
		* looking for something
		* Reading text (have them read aloud)
		* Hypothesizing about how the system might work
		* Interpreting system options
		* Interpreting system feedback
		* Explaining decisions
		* Feeling frustrated, happy
	+ Advantages
		* hear how the user thinks about the task
		* learn what the user actually sees and notices
		* hear how the user interprets options, feedback
	+ Disadvantages
		* timing will not be realistic
		* attention to detail will not be quite realistic
		* need to determine "rules of engagement" for questions, mistakes, etc.
			- are you not going to act like a normal person and just NOT answer them? State that up front
- 

### L7: User Testing, Part 3

- Debrief (after tasks)
	+ Review problems, get more information
	+ Ask about usefulness, value
	+ Ask about perceived usability, aesthetics, credibility
	+ compare to known alternatives
- Making Sense of the Test
	+ Capture "critical incidents"
		* errors
		* expressions of frustration
		* breakdowns
			- something took a really long time but should've been quick
			- roundabout processes
		* pleasant surprises
	+ Assess success/failure
		* usually a spectrum
	+ Capture overall reaction & reaction to specific aspects
	+ Link incidents, success/failure, and subjective reaction
- Learning from the Test
	+ Quick! Write it down!
	+ Critical Incidents and WHY they happened
		* mental model mismatches
		* misinterpretations
		* invalid assumptions made by the system
		* missing user needs
		* too little flexibility
		* too little guidance
	+ Here are some more high-level questions for them?
		* What is your overall impression of *the product*?
		* Do you think that *the product* would be useful for you, personally? Why or why not?
		* If no: who do you think it would be useful for? Why?
		* What do you like best about *the product*?
		* What do you think needs to be improved?
	+ Follow-up with some questions about the specific product that is relevant to THEM as a person. Here is an example of some of those questions using Doodle as the product:
		* How often do you schedule meetings with other people?
		* How do you usually go about scheduling such meetings?
		* Have you ever used any sites or apps that you think are similar to Doodle? Which ones, and how much experience have you had with them?
		* How many hours per week would you estimate that you spend online?
	+ Problems => Severity: impact on...
		* success/failure
			- did the problems affect the success or failure of the task? Some problems are show-stoppers and others are not
		* subjective experience
			- how did they problems affect their experience? Did it completely ruin it?
		* product goals
			- did they use the product in a different way than you expected?
	+ Other UX factors
		* usefulness
		* desirability
		* credibility
	+ Wrap up your de-brief with a summary of the following items:
		* Participants: who they were / kind of users they were
		* Basic Results: how well did the test go, did they succeed? Did all participants succeed? Any partial or complete failures?
		* Findings and Recommendations:
			- report major problems and try to diagnose the causes
			- Focus on the few significant observations, not a long list of minor things
			- What worked well? What didn't? What were the most confusing / frustrating parts?
			- Support findings with your EVIDENCE
- One Other VERY IMPORTANT Thing
	+ participation is voluntary
	+ participants can stop at any time
	+ you are testing the system, not the participant
	+ you need to let the participants know this
		* make them feel comfortable! The system is being tested, which means that they're struggles are really the struggles of the system
- What's "Micro" About This?
	+ relaxed recruiting
		* people close enough to target audience to be able to imagine
		* A.K.A. "Hallway" usability test
	+ Fewer tasks
		* < 30 minutes rather than 60-90 minutes
	+ Little or no data collection
		* no recording
		* no questionnaires
		* no logging
	+ Off-the-cuff analysis

- For the assignment, I need to prepare two test scripts (or one script with two versions):
	+ Moderator Script - one for MY reference with the tasks, my notes and tips, etc.
	+ Participant Script - this contains ONLY the tasks to be shared with the participant
- Make sure the assignments are timed; you don't have to rush through them
- Debrief
	+ write down your notes about their performance

## Part 3: UX Research Overview - Part 2

### Script for Micro-Usability Test Plan

#### Preamble
Hi, my name is Stanley, 


Thank you so much for coming. How are you today? Today we’d like you to help us understand how well the site Cars.com help people explore and find cars they want. So, we’d like you to do a couple of tasks using the site and collect your feedback. Specifically we’d like to know what you think about the site, and what works and doesn’t work for you. Your feedback will help us learn how we can improve the site. 


Before we start, here are several things I’d like you to know. First of all, we’re testing the site but not you. There’s nothing you can do wrong. So don’t worry about making any mistakes. If you cannot get something to work, or you think there’s anything broken or wrong or weird or confusing, it is not your fault but the system’s fault. Please let us know exactly what you think about the site. You can be honest. You won’t hurt anyone’s feelings if you say something bad about it. This is actually why we are bringing you here today to let us know which part of the site doesn’t do a good job. 


I’ll tell you what tasks to do using the site. After you start, please try to focus on the tasks, but I may ask you a few questions during test. You can also ask me questions, but I may not be able to answer all of them, because we’re trying to observe what people do when there’s no one sitting next to them. But I’ll try to answer questions you still have when we are done.


As we go along, I’m going to ask you to think aloud, which means that you speak all of your thoughts while you’re using the site, for example: what you’re looking at, what you’re trying to do, what you’re doing and thinking, why you’re doing and thinking that way. If you can’t find a way to complete a task and you think you’re stuck, let me know and you can move on to the next one. For each task you’re asked to do, tell me “I’m done” when you think you are done.


**Do you have any questions for me before we begin?**

#### Pre-Test Questions

Before we look at the site, I’d like to ask you just a few quick questions. 

1. First, what’s your occupation? 

2. Roughly how many hours a week would you say you spend using the Internet, including email and messaging?

3. How often do you shop online, and what types of products do you purchase online? 

4. Can you tell us a couple of your favorite sites for shopping?

**Now I’m going to ask your experience of purchasing vehicles.**

1. How many vehicles have you owned 

2. How many times have you purchased vehicles online?

3. What factors do you consider when you buy a vehicle?

**Follow up: which factor is most important to you?**

1. How far are you willing to travel to a dealer to buy a automobile?


**Read Description (20 seconds)**

Now I’m going to ask you to do some specific tasks. I’ll read each one out loud and here’s a printed copy for your reference.

And again, it’d be much helpful if you can think out loud as you go along.

#### Task 1: (10 minutes)

A family member of yours asks if you can find a car for her using Cars.com because she has been very busy recently. She wants to buy a used Honda Civic that:

- Is not older than 3 years
- Uses automatic transmission
- Is under $20,000 US dollars
- Is either grey, white, or black. 
- She also doesn’t want to travel too far away from home, and she wants the car to be as cheap as possible. 
 
**Find two cars based on her preference.**

Great thanks, here’s the the second thing I’d like you to do

#### Task 2: (10 minutes) 

You are in the market for a new car. You have saved $4000 for a down payment and have determined that you can afford a monthly payment of at most $400 towards a five-year car loan. Figure out the maximum price you can afford for a new car.

#### Task 3: (15 minutes)

You want to buy a new car using Cars.com that fits into your budget (as determined in the previous task). Use Cars.com to find a car for yourself, using using your own criteria, such as price, appearance, and engine. Find at least two cars that you’re interested in and put them in your list so that you can compare them later.

#### Task 4 (optional)

You have saved two cars, and now you want to compare the cars. Choose one you like the most. and plan your visit to the dealer(s) on this weekend that sells the car. In addition, find out what other cars are also available at the dealers.

#### Debriefing (1-2 minutes)
That was great. Thank you for the feedback, We have learned so much from you. Now I’m going to wrap up with a couple of questions”

1. Which part of the site did you find difficult or easy to use for the tasks?

2. Is there anything on the interface that didn't make sense to you, or is confusing to you?

3. I noticed that you… (fill in with questions around what you noticed about their actions)

4. What were you thinking when you… (fill in with questions around what)

**Do you have any final comments or questions?**

..

OK Thank you so much again for your time and participation.  If you have any other thoughts or ideas coming up, please let me know.

### Lecture 8: UX Design Overview

- What is Design?
	+ it's not just what it looks like; design is how it works
	+ Design is a plan for arranging elements in such a way to best accomplish a particular purpose
- What is design?
	+ a plan
	+ arranging elements
	+ a purpose
	+ what it looks like / feels like
- What is design?
	+ Design is *solving problems*
	+ Design is as much a matter of finding problems as solving them
- The Design Process
	+ Understand the problem
	+ Generate Possible Solutions
	+ Analyze and Select
	+ Embody the solutions (i.e. build a prototype)
	+ Assess (find new problems)
- 50 Problems in 50 Days
	+ [http://50problems50days.com/](http://50problems50days.com/)
- What is special about UX Design?
	+ Experiences are interactive
		* time-based
		* action-response rules
		* Action: command options (things that users can do)
		* Response: information presentation
		* Complex system behavior (focus on usability)
	+ Context is Critical
		* other interactions
- The UX Design Process

|Step|Actions|
|:---:|:---:|
|Understand the problem|Study users: tasks and context|
|Generate Possible Solutions|Sketch, storyboard, wireframe|
|Analyze and Select|Apply UX criteria|
|Embody the solutions|build prototype|
|Assess (find new problems)|Apply UX research methods|

- ...and Repeat!
