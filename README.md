# README

These are my notes on UX (user experience) Research and Design. Courses are based on the EdX Micro Masters program [User Experience (UX) Research and Design](https://www.edx.org/micromasters/michiganx-user-experience-ux-research-and-design) by the University of Michigan. These are the courses I plan to complete:

## Follow-up Work To Do

- Introduction to User Experience
	+ Write down the four components of UX and get the main questions from the slide deck as to what each is trying to solve/account for. *Why?* I think this will give me a good foundation or frame for everything that UX is. Even if it's primitive, this can be the best substitute for actual "first principles" in UX.
	+ Write a rubric / cheat sheet for the entire user-testing process from choosing the methodology, writing up the test (i.e. task-writing), to the debrief. *Why?* This will give me a basic skeleton for which ALL my testing can be understood and placed. It'll allow me to understand where these methodologies fit in and the purpose of each phase of the process.
	+ Write a rubric / cheat sheet for  wording a task (see these [lecture notes](https://github.com/coolinmc6/design-ux-ui/blob/master/UMI-Intro-to-User-Experience/Notes.md#l6-user-testing-part-2)). *Why?* I will need to perform user-tests and having this is a foundation will make all tests better.
	+ Write a rubric / cheat sheet for a debrief. *Why?* The [lecture](https://github.com/coolinmc6/design-ux-ui/blob/master/UMI-Intro-to-User-Experience/Notes.md#l7-user-testing-part-3) on the debrief has some great little tips and suggestions that I just need to get on paper. Just take the best ones, organize them in a way that makes sense, and move on.
- Principles of Designing for Humans
	+ Write a more-thorough breakdown of the [Heuristics for Design](https://github.com/coolinmc6/design-ux-ui/blob/master/UMI-Principles-of-Designing-for-Humans/Notes.md#l8-heuristics-for-design) with examples of each. *Why?* In addition to increasing my own understanding, this could be easily passed on and used as a common set of guideliness that everyone can use to understand a web app or project. These heuristics were designed for the layman to get up-and-running relatively quickly.
	+ Write a brief summary of the Gestalt Principles based on my [notes]() and the articles below. *Why?* These principles appear to be foundational knowledge about how humans perceive things that I could learn once and it would be relevant essentially forever.
