### Follow-up Work To Do

- Introduction to User Experience
	+ Write down the four components of UX and get the main questions from the slide deck as to what each is trying to solve/account for. *Why?* I think this will give me a good foundation or frame for everything that UX is. Even if it's primitive, this can be the best substitute for actual "first principles" in UX.
	+ Write a rubric / cheat sheet for the entire user-testing process from choosing the methodology, writing up the test (i.e. task-writing), to the debrief. *Why?* This will give me a basic skeleton for which ALL my testing can be understood and placed. It'll allow me to understand where these methodologies fit in and the purpose of each phase of the process.
	+ Write a rubric / cheat sheet for  wording a task (see these [lecture notes](https://github.com/coolinmc6/design-ux-ui/blob/master/UMI-Intro-to-User-Experience/Notes.md#l6-user-testing-part-2)). *Why?* I will need to perform user-tests and having this is a foundation will make all tests better.
	+ Write a rubric / cheat sheet for a debrief. *Why?* The [lecture](https://github.com/coolinmc6/design-ux-ui/blob/master/UMI-Intro-to-User-Experience/Notes.md#l7-user-testing-part-3) on the debrief has some great little tips and suggestions that I just need to get on paper. Just take the best ones, organize them in a way that makes sense, and move on.
- Principles of Designing for Humans
	+ Write a more-thorough breakdown of the [Heuristics for Design](https://github.com/coolinmc6/design-ux-ui/blob/master/UMI-Principles-of-Designing-for-Humans/Notes.md#l8-heuristics-for-design) with examples of each. *Why?* In addition to increasing my own understanding, this could be easily passed on and used as a common set of guideliness that everyone can use to understand a web app or project. These heuristics were designed for the layman to get up-and-running relatively quickly.
	+ Write a brief summary of the Gestalt Principles based on my [notes]() and the articles below. *Why?* These principles appear to be foundational knowledge about how humans perceive things that I could learn once and it would be relevant essentially forever.
		* [https://www.usertesting.com/blog/gestalt-principles/](https://www.usertesting.com/blog/gestalt-principles/)
		* [https://uxplanet.org/gestalt-theory-for-ux-design-principle-of-proximity-e56b136d52d1](https://uxplanet.org/gestalt-theory-for-ux-design-principle-of-proximity-e56b136d52d1)
- Understanding User Needs
	+ Create a checklist / cheatsheet on conducting a good interview (pre-interview prep, in-interview tips, and post-interview analysis). It doesn't have to be long but a good breakdown by each step. **Do this after the task above the user-testing experience.** It sounds like the task above from Intro to User Experience is similar. Why?* I can use this as a general guide forever. I'd also like to have something for employees to keep as a guide to create some minimum standards.
- UX Design: From Concept to Wireframe
	+ Create a Toolkit based on the [four main parts of design](https://github.com/coolinmc6/design-ux-ui/blob/master/UMI-UX-Design-From-Concept-to-Wireframe/Notes.md#l2-design-process---an-overview). Describe each of the main parts and how to perform them effectively.

## Product Design Processes

### Design Telepathy's Product Design Process

- Here are the main sections:
	+ Defining Product Vision
	+ Research and Validation
	+ Understanding Design Systems
	+ Rapid Ideation
	+ Understanding Users and Relationships
	+ Preparing to Design
	+ Design and Build
- **Defining Product Vision**
	+ The Future Press Release
	+ The Manifesto
	+ [Your Complete Guide to Setting Your Product Vision & Value Proposition](https://www.dtelepathy.com/blog/products/product-value-proposition)
		* great summary of what Design Telepathy thinks on setting the vision for a product / project and understanding your value proposition
		* It is pretty much Amazon's method plus [mapping the customer experience](https://www.dtelepathy.com/blog/business/experience-mapping) and creating a user manual
	+ [Design the Beginning](https://medium.com/the-year-of-the-looking-glass/design-the-beginning-b8e61081ce42)
		* great article, worth reading again
		* when designing a product, it's easy to start at the middle where the main character already **knows about** your product.
		* we always want to just assume that people will see straight through to the potential of this new product/feature/etc. and just "get it"
		* "Nobody cares about the thing you’ve designed, unless you can get them past the beginning."
		* The "beginning" is how you introduce something new to a person and **how** you will get them to understand its value and actually use it every day/week/whatever
		* Here are some of the questions you should answer BEFORE you start building it:
			- Where and how will people first hear about your product or feature?
			- What should people understand about your product at a glance, and is that compelling enough to convince them to go through the trouble of trying it out?
			- What should people’s first-time experience through your product be, and how do you plan to demonstrate to them its value within the first minute?
			- How will you build out the social graph, content inventory, marketplace, etc. if the success of your product is dependent on those things?
			- What would compel somebody to come back and use your product a second or third time?
		* she recommends designing the marketing page (app store submission, website, etc.) and the new user experience (the step-by-step flow for first-time user) first.
		* these designs don't have to be high-fidelity but they should capture what your product is and can deliver to users
		* By designing the beginning, you can make sure that:
			- your value proposition is clear
			- your messaging makes sense and, again, is ***clear***
			- the path from sign-up to 
	+ [The North Star](https://medium.com/the-year-of-the-looking-glass/designs-north-star-d469193063c5)
	+ [Business Model Canvas](https://strategyzer.com/canvas/business-model-canvas)
		* I've seen something similar ([Lean Canvas](https://leanstack.com/leancanvas)) and it looks like it would work better as a completely new enterprise as opposed to just a single product. There are some good questions that would naturally come up if you force yourself to complete it quickly; e.g. in 20 minutes.
	+ [Writing Product Vision](https://www.scrumalliance.org/community/articles/2009/january/the-product-vision)
		* the focus of this article is making sure that you have clearly articulated the vision for your product / project
		* Here is a good list of questions to answer:
			- Who is going to buy the product? Who is the target customer? 
			- Which customer needs will the product address? 
			- Which product attributes are critical to satisfy the needs selected, and therefore for the success of the product? 
			- How does the product compare against existing products, both from competitors and the same company? What are the product’s unique selling points? 
			- What is the target timeframe and budget to develop and launch the product?
		* A Good Product Vision Is....
			- Clear and stable - the product vision should allow us to see the future product
			- Broad and Engaging - describe a broad and engaging goal that guides development but also allows for creativity
			- Short and Sweet - brief and concise
		* Does your product vision pass the elevator test?
			- can you explain your product in the time it takes to ride up in an elevator?
	+ [Objective-Based Design](https://www.dtelepathy.com/blog/philosophy/objective-based-design-creative-approach-to-solving-business-challenge)
		* I haven't had a chance to really dig in - the page didn't load properly for some reason. **MUST REVISIT**
- **Research and Validation**
	+ Research Plan
		* [The UX Research Plan That Stakeholders Love](https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2012/01/ux-research-plan-stakeholders-love/)
			- great overview of what a research plan is and why you should do one.
			- Both "not doing research" and "doing a ton of research" are unattractive options: this is the one-pager that answers it all (kinda)
			- it's the "start" of a research project to set the right expectations, boil down what you know and what you want to learn, and secure buy-in for the UX research by making it a team effort.
			- **Title**. The title should combine the thing you’re studying and the methodology; for example, “Monster.com field study” or “XYZ Phone data-entry usability test.” Sometimes mentioning the target audience of the study is also appropriate; for example, “Whitehouse.com news page interviews with senior citizens.”
			- **Author and stakeholders**. State your full name, title and email address on one line. After you get the stakeholders’ buy-in for the plan, add their details as well — the research belongs to everyone now.
			- **Date**. Update it whenever the plan is updated.
			- **Background**. Describe what led to this study. Discuss the recent history of the project. Be brief, no more than five lines.
			- **Goals**. Briefly state the high-level reason (or reasons) for conducting this study. Try to phrase it in one sentence. If that wouldn’t make sense, create a numbered list of very short goal statements. If you have more than three to four goals, you are either aiming too high (meaning you have too many goals) or repeating yourself.
			- **Research questions**. These are the specifics, the core of your plan. Provide a numbered list of questions that you plan to answer during the study. It is extremely important that your stakeholders understand that you will not necessarily be asking the study participants these questions. As a rule of thumb, have no more than seven to ten questions, preferably around five. Later on, you will construct your study script to answer these questions. An effective way to think about research questions is to imagine that they are the headings in the study’s summary.
			- **Methodology**. In an academic environment, this section has one primary goal: to provide as many details as other researchers need in order to repeat the exact same study. In practice, the goal of the methodology section is to briefly inform the stakeholders of what will happen, for how long and where.
			- **Participants**. Provide a list of the primary characteristics of the people you will be recruiting to participate in the study. Have a good reason for each and every characteristic. If you have two participant groups, describe both groups’ characteristics in lists or in a table. Append a draft form that you’ll use to screen participants.
			- **Schedule**. Inform stakeholders of at least three important dates: when recruiting starts, when the study will take place, and when they can expect results. Large research projects require more scheduling details. For example, if the study involves travel to another city or country, more dates might be required for on-site preparation and meetings or for analysis workshops.
			- **Script placeholder**. When a full study script is ready, it will appear under this title. Until then, all you need is a heading with a “TBD” indication.
	+ Asking the Right Questions
	+ Synthesizing the Data
	+ User Testing
	+ Heuristic Evaluations
		* this is designed to find the pure functionality and usability issues in the product
		* user testing looks for *behavioral patterns*
	+ Resources

			- I saw these listed from my UMI course. Understanding these on a deeper level
- **Understanding Design Systems**
	+ Platform Audit
	+ Ecosystem Mapping
	+ Competitive and Comparative Audits
	+ Resources
		* [The step-by-step guide to an effective UX audit](https://www.invisionapp.com/inside-design/guide-to-effective-ux-audit/)
- **Rapid Ideation**
	+ Design Sprints
		* [How to assemble your design sprint team](https://www.invisionapp.com/inside-design/assembling-design-sprint-team/)
			- great info on getting people into the *mood* to do a Sprint. Not everyone will see the value; not everyone will buy in. Some interesting info in this about getting people to try it.

### Michael Siebel: Product Development Cycle Fundamentals

- Some of their (Justin.tv) major problems with product development included:
	+ Unfocused product meetings that were **not written down**
	+ Products were poorly spec'd out or not spec'd out at all
	+ Too focused on fully-formed products as opposed to MVPs
	+ Rarely spec'd analytics for new products and thus had no idea how they were performing post-launch
	+ Development cycles ran months-long
		* they were sick of the new feature by the time it launched so they didn't iterate
	+ Product roadmap was too long so team members weren't excited to brainstorm new products
	+ Product decisions were made exclusively by founders in a non-transparent process
- Just using the opposite of each of these (before reading the rest of the post), what **should** a good product cycle do or have?
	+ Focused product meetings (they have an agenda) with the resulting meeting notes written down and distributed
	+ Products are carefully spec'd out and understood by everyone working on it
	+ Build MVPs and then iterate - don't build the *whole thing at once*
	+ Identify important metrics related to the product and track them post-launch
	+ Shorten your product roadmap or reduce how attached your are to it; be responsive to successes in your releases
	+ Make product decisions in a more open, transparent way
- This post is what Michael Siebel used at Socialcam; it's broken down into a couple concrete tips/suggestions
- **Tip #1:** Define Your Development Cycle Length
	+ development cycle is dictated by your product: iOS apps may need two weeks, web apps maybe a week, hardware could be longer
	+ The **key** is to make the cycle short enough so that the team can stay excited and still feel like they can brainstorm new ideas
- **Tip #2:** Determine Your Goal(s) and Identify the Product Lead
	+ They had one team meeting and it was their product meeting which happened at the first day of the dev cycle
	+ Socialcam had three main objectives that every product meeting was focused around:
		* increasing content creation
		* increasing new users
		* increasing retention
	+ They'd pick a goal and that would be the focus for the next two weeks
	+ He isn't explicit about whether the product lead changes or whether it's the same every time but this quote below is good. He goes into more of some of the responsibilities of the Product Lead and some of the behaviors of that person

> As the product person on the team my role was to protect and improve the dev cycle and moderate the product meetings to ensure all team members felt comfortable contributing. Oftentimes just getting the opportunity to voice your idea and having it written on the board - even if it isn’t built - massively increases buy-in of the process.

	+ **CM Note:** those three objectives were decided BEFORE this meeting. Understanding what your team is trying to achieve and having some core objectives is important. Other companies talk about a "North Star" metric that guides all product discussions.
- **Tip #3:** Organized and Inclusive Brainstorm
	+ They would write ideas down on the whiteboard in one of the following categories:
		* new features / feature iterations
		* maintenance
		* A/B tests
- **Tip #4:** 
- **Tip #5:** 
- **Tip #6:** 
- **Tip #7:**

		* CEO sets the company's objectives
		* Employees' OKR's were never really
		* Keys to OKRs
			- OKR's are:
				+ set quarterly and annually
				+ measurable
				+ set at personal, team, and company levels
				+ publicly available to the entire company
				+ graded each quarter
		* Elements of an OKR
			- The *Objective* is:
				+ ambitious
				+ feels a tad uncomfortable
			- The *Key Results*:
				+ clearly make the objective achievable
				+ are quantifiable
				+ lead to objective grading
		* Personal / Team / Company
			- Personal OKRs define what the person is working on
			- Team OKRs define priorities for the team, not just a collection of all individual OKRs
			- Company OKRs are big picture, top-level focus for the entire company
		* Sample Personal OKRs
			- Objective: Accelerate Blogger Revenue Growth
			- Key Results:
				+ launch "monetize" to allow one-click ad revenue
				+ Implement AdSense Host Channel Placement targting RPM's by xx%
				+ Launch 3 revenue-specific experiments to learn what drives revenue growth
				+ Finalize PRD (Product Requirements Doc) for Blogger Ad Network, secure eng allocation to build in Q1
			- Objective: Improve Blogger's Reputation
