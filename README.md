# README

These are my notes on UX (user experience) Research and Design courses, articles, books, and other resources related to UX. There are a couple main areas:

- [University of Michigan MicroMasters courses](#umi-micromasters)
- [Udemy Courses](#udemy-courses)

## University of Michigan MicroMasters courses

Courses are based on the EdX Micro Masters program [User Experience (UX) Research and Design](https://www.edx.org/micromasters/michiganx-user-experience-ux-research-and-design) by the University of Michigan. These are the courses I plan to complete:

### Follow-up Work To Do

- Introduction to User Experience
	+ Write down the four components of UX and get the main questions from the slide deck as to what each is trying to solve/account for. *Why?* I think this will give me a good foundation or frame for everything that UX is. Even if it's primitive, this can be the best substitute for actual "first principles" in UX.
	+ Write a rubric / cheat sheet for the entire user-testing process from choosing the methodology, writing up the test (i.e. task-writing), to the debrief. *Why?* This will give me a basic skeleton for which ALL my testing can be understood and placed. It'll allow me to understand where these methodologies fit in and the purpose of each phase of the process.
	+ Write a rubric / cheat sheet for  wording a task (see these [lecture notes](https://github.com/coolinmc6/design-ux-ui/blob/master/UMI-Intro-to-User-Experience/Notes.md#l6-user-testing-part-2)). *Why?* I will need to perform user-tests and having this is a foundation will make all tests better.
	+ Write a rubric / cheat sheet for a debrief. *Why?* The [lecture](https://github.com/coolinmc6/design-ux-ui/blob/master/UMI-Intro-to-User-Experience/Notes.md#l7-user-testing-part-3) on the debrief has some great little tips and suggestions that I just need to get on paper. Just take the best ones, organize them in a way that makes sense, and move on.
- Principles of Designing for Humans
	+ Write a more-thorough breakdown of the [Heuristics for Design](https://github.com/coolinmc6/design-ux-ui/blob/master/UMI-Principles-of-Designing-for-Humans/Notes.md#l8-heuristics-for-design) with examples of each. *Why?* In addition to increasing my own understanding, this could be easily passed on and used as a common set of guideliness that everyone can use to understand a web app or project. These heuristics were designed for the layman to get up-and-running relatively quickly.
	+ Write a brief summary of the Gestalt Principles based on my [notes]() and the articles below. *Why?* These principles appear to be foundational knowledge about how humans perceive things that I could learn once and it would be relevant essentially forever.
		* [https://www.usertesting.com/blog/gestalt-principles/](https://www.usertesting.com/blog/gestalt-principles/)
		* [https://uxplanet.org/gestalt-theory-for-ux-design-principle-of-proximity-e56b136d52d1](https://uxplanet.org/gestalt-theory-for-ux-design-principle-of-proximity-e56b136d52d1)
- Understanding User Needs
	+ Create a checklist / cheatsheet on conducting a good interview (pre-interview prep, in-interview tips, and post-interview analysis). It doesn't have to be long but a good breakdown by each step. **Do this after the task above the user-testing experience.** It sounds like the task above from Intro to User Experience is similar. Why?* I can use this as a general guide forever. I'd also like to have something for employees to keep as a guide to create some minimum standards.
- UX Design: From Concept to Wireframe
	+ Create a Toolkit based on the [four main parts of design](https://github.com/coolinmc6/design-ux-ui/blob/master/UMI-UX-Design-From-Concept-to-Wireframe/Notes.md#l2-design-process---an-overview). Describe each of the main parts and how to perform them effectively.

## Questions

#### What is the difference between Product Design vs. UX Design?

[Product Design vs UX Design: what’s the difference?](https://uxdesign.cc/product-design-vs-ux-design-whats-the-difference-461b3f11b76b)

- Quote: "Design will not be just about users. It will also be about the business. As Product Designers, we must drive product solutions that service the goals of both the users and the company."

[UX design vs. product design: what is the difference?](https://uxdesign.cc/ux-design-verses-product-design-whats-the-difference-577b3eab19c0)

- both use the "Design Thinking Process"

![Design Thinking Process](https://github.com/coolinmc6/design-ux-ui/blob/master/UMI-UX-Design-From-Concept-to-Wireframe/Course-Documents/design-thinking-process.jpeg)

[Product Designer VS UX designer：Which One You Prefer to Be?](https://www.mockplus.com/blog/post/product-designer-vs-ux-designer)

- The **Product Designer** handles the overall function and working process of the product. They are the guardians of user needs. 
- **UX Designers** are responsible for the function of the user interface and user-friendly experience.
