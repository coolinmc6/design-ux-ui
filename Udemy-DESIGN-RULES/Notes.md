## Ground Rules: What You Need to Know Upfront

### Design is Design is Design

- "If you can design one thing, you can design *everything*." - Massimo Vignelli
- design is **solving problems**. Not drawing pictures
- Design is a problem-solving discipline
	+ does the design serve the purpose of its existence?
	+ how should it be perceived (and received) by the viewer/audience
	+ what does that matter to anyone?
- "If you don't have a good solution, yo don't have a good problem."
	+ what is it supposed to do?
	+ You need to properly define the problem
- The principles of **good graphic design** are the same principles that dictate **good UI design**
- nothing in UI design should be arbitrary or "just because it looks cool"
- design is design is design.
	- It doesn't matter, they're all the same; you are always starting by figuring out what people are trying to accomplish
* **UI Design Mantra #1: Design is Design is Design**

[back to top](#top)

### Stop Solving Other People's Problems

- don't look at themes
	+ themes look nice - but they offer no explanation of what, how and why
		* they don't tell us anything about the problems they were solving to create them
- Do you start the design process by looking at the work of other designers
+ don't look for inspiration
	* you will only find someone else's solution to someone else's problem
	* the problem you have to solve belongs exclusively to you, your client and your users
	* "Do not seek to follow in the footsteps of the wise. Seek what they sought.
+ Don't look at trends
	* flat design has become a widespread trend
		- designers are adopting th elook without considering whether it's appropriate for the situation or whether people understand what they see
		- flat design without visual affordances makes it difficult for the user to understand what they're seeing is interactive
+ Design vs decoration
	* designer = things hard about the appropriateness of the visual decisions they make, and those decisions are informed by research, investigation and fact
		- context of use
	* decorator = relies on his/her instincts as to what looks good and what doesn't. Most designers who've never learned the timeless principles of design are in this category
+ **UI Design Mantra #2: Stop Solving Other People's Problems**

[back to top](#top)

### Form Doesn't (and Shouldn't) Follow Function?

- On the surface, "form follows function" seems to make a lot of sense
- In terms of UI design, it's applied like this:
	+ "gather" the product's requirements from the client, then
	+ Determine the aesthetics of the UI based on those requirements
	+ it's not that simple
- "Form follows function" has been:
	+ co-opted
	+ misinterpreted
	+ misapplied
- In order to understand it, understand how it came to be:
	+ Louis Sullivan start it all in 1986
	+ Sullivan was a rebel, bucking the forms of buildings still based on ancient Greek and Roman architecture
	+ Believed new form for buildings was needed
	+ Frank Lloyd Wright: form and function should be one
	+ Guggenheim museum is a spiral so that people could easily see the art
	+ Adolf Loos was againsg ornamentation
	+ Walt Gropius founded bauhaus: architecture beigns where the engineering ends
		* Bauhaus was a school of multidisciplinary design
		* Form had to reflect the function of the product
		* Bauhaus was the foundation for modern graphic design
			- connection between color and shape
			- clean, powerful typography
			- spatial relationships and integration of shape, colo, and typography
			- core principles of visual design such as harmony, balance, rhythm, proportion, symmetry and synthesis
	+ modern graphic design is the foundation of US Design
	+ Universal Principles of Design = get this book!
- **UI Design Mantra #3: Form Doesn't (and Shouldn't) Follow Function**

[back to top](#top)

### Balancing Form and Function: Prescription vs. Description

- the thing that will make you a great designer is your understanding of the "why" you are making the visual decisions you make
- Description
	+ beauty results from purity of function (not ornamentation)
	+ this derives from the believe that form follows function in nature
- Prescription
	+ aesthetic considerations should be secondary to functional considerations
	+ **This is the one that's gotten us into so much trouble**
- Description
	+ Nature => variations in form allow some species to succeed, survive and flourish
	+ Product Design => variations in form of products compete for sales
- Prescription
	+ Dogma => prioritize functionality over all other design considerations
		* insist aesthetic considerations in design should be secondary to functional considerations
	+ Product Design => designers and developer are led to ask a very wrong question: what elements here don't specifically serve a function - and should be removed?
- Logically....
	- if the form of a design was ruled solely by its function, then every functional item would have one and only one design solution
	- every element would ultimately have the same design

[back to top](#top)

### Why Form Follows Function is NOT a UI Design Prescription

- Reality Check #1 - Users are most often frustrated and confused when confronted with visual form that strictly reflects technical function
- Design according to implementation
	+ Implementation Model (reflects technology) vs. Mental Model (user's understanding)
- Do you really need to know the mechanics of how something works in order to use it?
	+ Answer: **NO**
- As users, we don't care how it works
	+ our focus is on the experience
	+ we have a mental model that predicts the experience and tells us what we can expect
	+ When the UI sticks close to our mental model, it's easier
- Reality Check #2: Form should be determined by success criteria - not by function or personal aesthetic preferences
	+ be interested in outcomes, not features
	+ Form follows function only works in situations where something only has one function
	+ convenience trumps best practice all the time
- What visually communicates value?
- Reality Check #3: Function is onlly a single, isolated aspect of what drives and influences form

[back to top](#top)

### Every Force Evloves Form (So Don't Follow the Prescription)

- Every force evolves a form
- what really drives form?
	+ audience needs
	+ client desires
	+ ethical obligations
	+ aesthetic inclinations
	+ technology constraints
	+ cultural presuppositions
	+ functional requirements
	+ material properties
	+ available time
	+ available budget
	+ available resources
- The form of a digital product is a balance between:
	+ UI design
	+ information architecture
	+ front-end HTML/CSS
	+ middle tier logic
	+ backend data structures
	+ programming and processes
- Don't use form follows function as a prescription
	+ focus on the relative importance of form and function
- Allow the **description** of "form follows function" to guide your efforts
- **UI Design Mantra #4: Force Evolves Form**

[back to top](#top)

### Less is More: Small Screens, Big Challenges

- research has shows that visual complexity can obstruct a user's perception within 50 milliseconds of exposure
- if it looks too complex we assume it's hard to user (or at least time-consuming)
- but this isn't about simplicity for simplicity's sake
- but don't get too far
	+ common UI elements: buttons, menus, common actions, are a very significant part of what makes a site or app useful
- Hiding elements can be costly
	+ icons without labels are worse than labels alone
- Expecting users to discover interactions through trial and error is a recipe for disaster

[back to top](#top)

### Five Rules for Effective UI Design on Small Screens

- #1. Focus on context of use
	+ when are people using the app/site?
	+ are they stressed? bored? busy? lost?
	+ the available features and functions - and the way they work - should fit the situation
- #2. Simplify, simplify, simplify
	+ each screen should contain one primary action
	+ every screen should provide something useful, meaningful, and valuable
	+ abandon the idea that the number of screen (or steps) matters. It doesn't
- #3. Design for thumbs?
	+ most people rely on one or both thumbs to interact on phones
- #4. Design for fat fingers
	+ minimum 48px in diameter
	+ anything smaller makes it hard to tap easily and accurately
	+ provide ample space between targets so users don't accidentally tap the wrong target
- #5. Minimize the need to type
	+ it's a slow, error-prone process
	+ keep forms short and simple
	+ use auto-complete and personalized data where possible
- **UI Design Mantra #5: On Small Screens, Less is More**

[back to top](#top)

## Organizing Visual Information

### Balance: Creating Visual Order

- Balancing any layout arranging positive elements and negative elements so that no one area of the design overpowers the others (unless it's supposed to)
- everything works and fits together
- when a design is unbalanced, the individual elements compete with the whole
- Think of the Smashing website => grouping items to remove the number of "visual elements" that a user must "digest"

[back to top](#top)

### Case Studies: Improving Balance in the User Interface

- Balance creates order + signals relationships
	+ Drudge Report
		* making the three columns equal width
		* adding more space between the links
		* adding white space added some order
		* negative space can create the divider; you don't need the vertical line
- In a content-heavy layout, balancing negative an dpositive space is mission-critical
	+ htis allows the user to quickly scan, identify and group related visual elements
	+ negative space works to signal visual hierarchy - using size, weight and alignment
	+ its boundaires work to define and group visual information
- **UI Design Mantra #6: Balance creates visual order and signals relationships**

[back to top](#top)

### Rhythm: Establishing and Reinforcing Comprehension

- Rhythm occurs when the intervals between elements are predictable - and similar in size, shape and length
- When elements repeat at regular intervals, the visual rhythm speeds identification and the user's ability to quickly:
	+ infer what the elements are
	+ understand what they do
	+ two or or more of anything implies related structure
	+ if you create structure, you also have to control it
- **UI Design Mantra #7: Visual rhythm speeds comprehension and use.**

[back to top](#top)

### Harmony: Shaping the Parts Into a Whole

- harmony - when visual elements are in harmony, they relate to and complement each other
- harmony is a big part of what holds individual elements together visually, to form a greater, cohesive whole
- Harmony comes largely from rhythm and from repetition
- Repetition re-emphasizes visual elements, connecting and creating areas of attention

[back to top](#top)


### Using Harmony to Create Directional Flow

- Harmony is directional

[back to top](#top)

### Case Study: Using Harmony for Better Form Design

- First Name and Last Name are same width and their combined width is equivalent to the other inputs below it
- the Submit button is a purposeful anomaly
- the height of the inputs and buttons are the same
- vertical distance between the input fields is the same but the Submit button has a shorter vertical distance between it and the bottom input
- label and input styles repeated create **consistent visual intervals**
- **UI Design Mantra #8: Good design is held together by harmony.**

[back to top](#top)

### Dominance: Directing (and Maintaining) User Focus

- Dominance
	+ What's the first thing you see?
	+ Where is your attention drawn?
	+ Dominance is achieved by emphasizing one or more visual elements
	+ This creates a focal point where most people will instinctively go at first glance
	+ Dominance creates an entry point in the design; a starting point from which you can lead the viewer to other parts of the screen
- Dominance enables and directs flow	
	+ from a primary dominant design, flow is achieved by creating elements with secondary and tertiary dominance; in other words: **hierarchy**
	+ dominance relies on contrast - clear differences in the visual field
	+ by creating a dominant element, you reveal what's most important in your design
	+ you show people where to look first

[back to top](#top)

### Using Dominance to Increase Focus - and Decrease Cognitive Effort

- Dominance enables and directs flow
	+ when there's no clear dominance between elements, they compete with each other
	+ without a dominant element onscreen, users have to work to find their own entry point
	+ we're write to conserve effort, which means the least amount of work may be moving on to another design/screen/site/app
	+ something that's "too busy" lacks a dominant element

[back to top](#top)

### Creating Dominance with Size, Negative Space and Contrast

- more contrast = more dominance
	+ contrast > size
- more negative space = more dominance
- **UI Design Mantra #9: Dominance directs user focus.**

[back to top](#top)

### Alignment: Leading the Eye Across the Screen

- Alignment is the most important visual design principle but is often the most borken
- you don't always have to put a lines and boxes around items
	+ get in the habit of not putting a line or a stroke between items

[back to top](#top)

### Case Studies: The Power of Alignment

- aligning elements that are related by context creates visual order
- **UI Design Mantra #10: Align everything with everything else.**

[back to top](#top)

### Proximity: Showing and Communicating Visual Relationships

- Proximity is the distance between visual elements
- We use it to signal relationships between those elements
- elements visually close to each other are perceived as a single group, related by context of use
- unrelated items are visually separated, far from each other
- proximity describes relationships
- proximity often beats color and contrast

[back to top](#top)

### Using Proximity to Make Cofnition Faster

- proximity makes cognition faster
- proximity makes browsing easier
- **UI Design Mantra #11: Group and organize related content with proximity.**

[back to top](#top)


## Using Color and Contrast Appropriately

### Color: Getting Attention and Communicating Emotion

- color matters
	+ color gets attention
	+ color stires emotional reponse and suggests associated meaning
	+ to prevent confusion in meaning, color has to be used consistently
	+ to get the desired emotional response, color has to be used appropriately
	+ think of the red dot to highlight a particular screen
- color communicates
	+ the right colors draw the eye to the most important areas on the screen
	+ color can maximize readability and minimize optical fatigue
	+ color delivers symbolic meanings that support and enhance the visual experience of a design
	+ color pleases the eye and sustains visual interest

[back to top](#top)


### How Color Influences Interaction

- For Twitter, notice that the back button, the hashtag, the link - they're all blue to indicate that they are taking you somewhere
	+ the heart is red because it's a different kind of interaction
- **Color creates connection, continuity**
- color implies meaning
	+ color is subjective; our perceptions and biases affect what it says (and does) to us
	+ Some colors have universal appeal; others are specific to geography, culture and experience
- color should highlight, not determine
	+ color should never be the sole differentiator of things in the UI
	+ it should highlight and guide
	+ for extended screen use situations, use light, muted background color
	+ bright, saturated color should only be used as visual accents



[back to top](#top)


### A Word on Color Theory - and Using Color Correctly

- color theory is useful
	+ but it's also a real pain
	+ you're never going to understand to have the time you need to fully understand color theory, much less apply it during a project
	+ look up: Color Wheel and Color Theory
- Are you using color correctly?
	+ are colors used sparingly?
	+ do your colors reinforce and interfere with hierarchy and content?
	+ is the color scheme used consistenly?
	+ is color use functional, or just decorative?
	+ does functionality depend on color?
		* if I can't see that color properly, will it affect how I use the app
	+ Would this be just as functional for someone who's color blind?
- **UI Design Mantra #12: Use color to communicate and influence interaction.**

### How to Choose the Right Color for your UI: Common Associations

- consider common associations
- Black - authority and power; timeless; cool; brooding; counter culture (arts & music)
- White - innocence and purity; cleanliness and sterility; surrender and peace;
- Red - Alarm and urgency; attention; intensity; speed; warning of danger; love
- Black, white and red are the highest degree of contrast
- Pink - romance, gratitude; grace;admiration; harmony; compassion; female
- Blue - peaceful, tranquil; sk; ocean; business; technology; innovation; male
- Green - nature, organic; calming; refreshing; relaxing (hospital "green" rooms)
- Yellow - optimism, happiness; warmth (sunlight); positivity; joy, hope;
- Purple - royalty; wealth; luxury; sophistication; considered feminine and romantic
- Brown - nature; Earth; home, friendship; richness; genuineness; solidity


[back to top](#top)


### How to Choose the Right Color for your UI: Emotional Impact

- Red
	+ seeing red has psychological impact: it's been proven to increase blood circulation, breathing, metabolism
	+ Red elements demand to be noticed, scream for attention
	+ red also signifies importance and priority, like a to-do list
- Blue
	- Blue tends to have a calming, inviting eggect, due to associations with sky and water
	- It also communicates trust (banks, tech)
	- symbolized reliability and trust
	- lighter blues are open and friendly; darker shades suggest security
* Green
	- green is often associated with nature, success, growth and money
	- green sits right between warm and cool, making it well-balanced
	- it also feels fresh, new, and, in western culture, signifies all is OK

[back to top](#top)

### How to Choose the Right for your UI: From the World Around You

- Everything you see contains the four color variations required for good UI:
	+ shadows
	+ midtones
	+ highlights
	+ accents
- CM - from the examples, the shadow, midtone and highlights (darkest to lightest) are all in the same "family" of color and then the accent is picked to call out items

[back to top](#top)

### How to Choose the Right for your UI: From Brand Colors

- Most organizations have a brand color scheme they'll want to start with (usually at least a logo)
- most logos are too color saturated
- vibrant, saturated colors cause eye strain
- HSB - Hue-Saturation-Brightness
- Reduce saturation to more tolerable levels (i.e. 80's/90's down to 50's)
- **UI Design Mantra #13: Choose color based on associations, emotions, and brand.**

[back to top](#top)

### The Power of Contrast

- Contrast wins over color
- Your eyes look for contrast naturally

[back to top](#top)

### Using Contrast to Improve Readability, Attention and Focus

- Contrast enables readbility
	+ text is easily readable when start, complementary colors are used
	+ a design where text is the brightest element can reduce strain by focusing attention
	+ The fact that colors are complementary doesn't mean contrast is appropriate
- Contrast draws attention
	+ areas of highest contrast draw the user's attention
	+ constrast should be applied according to the importance of a particular element
	+ primary content or actions should have the most contrast
- Contrast directs focus
	+ wherever you apply the most contrast is where the user's attention will be drawn
	+ if that element isn't the most important thing, you're directing the user's focus in the wrong place
	+ design with contrast purposefully keeps the user's focus where it needs to be
	+ the core content or action should have the most contrast
	+ secondary content and actions (and everything else) should have lower contrast by degrees

[back to top](#top)

### Three Essential Functions of Contrast in UI Design

- Contrast performs 3 essential functions:
	+ 1. Contrast draws the user's attention to the essential components of the interface
	+ 2. Contrasts helps the user understand relationships between onscreen elements
	+ 3. Contrast communicates hierarchy and signifies importance within and across multiple sets of visual information
- **UI Design Mantra #14: Contrast always wins.**

[back to top](#top)

### How to Determine Appropriate Color and Contrast

- color and contrast depend on context
- how do we tell if contrast is appropriate

[back to top](#top)


## Designing with Typography and Imagery

### Typography 101: It's About Much More Than Choosing a Font!

- typography has one plain duty before it and that is to convey information in writing.

### Creating Emotional Impact with Typography

- Typography creates emotional impact
- typography serves functional purpose
- Appropriate typography choices create:
	+ readability
	+ accessibility
	+ usability
	+ visual balance

### Choosing a Font Isn't Typography: The Importance of Pattern Recognition

- Choosing a font isn't typography
	+ anyone can choose a font
	+ not everyone knows how to treat text as visual design - utilizing size, weight, space and style combinations - to establish visual order, signal relationships and enhance understanding
- pattern recognition


[back to top](#top)

### The Importance of Proper Alignment

- alignment
	- "rag-right" => not justified
	- center-aligned text has a different starting place for each line: paragraphs should never be center-aligned
* kerning
	- kerning - the space between letters
	- kerning is critical to legibility, readability, and comprehension
* leading
	- pronounced like the metal not like a "leader"
	- leading is the space between lines of text
	- in terms of UI design, we call it line height
	- increasing the leading makes text easier to scane and read, which makes comprehension a lot faster as well
	- it also serves to visually group text

[back to top](#top)

### Seven Rules for Great Typography

- 1. 2 typefaces max
	+ that means no more than 2 font families
	+ character widths and weights of each font should be complementary to the other
	+ Avenir and Georgia have similar character widths; that creates visual harmony
	+ At the same time, font pairings need to have some visual difference; otherwise, there's no reason to use the second font
- 2. Limit line width
	+ when line lengths are too wide, the eye has to work a lot hard to "track" the text - following and finding the beginning of the next line
	+ this makes reading and comprehension much more difficult (and slower)
	+ Limit 60 characters per line - desktop
	+ 30-40 characters per line - mobile
- 3. Choose readability
	+ the typefaces you choose have to be readable at all sizes (headings, body, buttons, labels, data, etc.)
	+ your typefaces should have enough height that letterforms don't degrade at small sizes
- 4. Choose legibility
	+ make sure all letterforms are clearly distinguishable in your typeface
	+ beware of L's that look like I's
	+ some fonts have poorly specified kerning
- 5. Use space between paragraphs
	+ visual breaks between paragaphs give the eyes a place to rest
- 6. Align text elements in layout using baselines
- 7. Use styles to visually differentiate content
	+ when choosing a typeface, you want one with at least: regular, italic and bold
	+ Use those styles in your design to differentiates between types of content
	+ example:
		* heading is largest and bold
		* sub-head is larger than body and italicized
		* body is regular style and normal size

[back to top](#top)

### Five Rules for Choosing Imagery

- 1. Make sure it serves a purpose
	+ and make sure you understand what that purpose is
	+ what message will it send?
	+ what emotions will it evoke
	+ how will it support/reinforce the content?
	+ how will it guide or instruct?
	+ does it strengthen and deepen understanding, or interfere/distract from it?
- 2. Focus on people (not things)
	+ You want people to see themselves using what you're promoting
	+ So an image of one of us using a product will always carry more resonance than an image of just that product
	+ images of people looking away from the camera is easier for us to imagine that that is us
- 3. Cropping can change meaning
	+ How you crop an image has a dramatic impact on how it's perceived
- 4. Never go for the cheap shot.
	+ don't be sexist or objectify people
	+ don't objectify - empower
- 5. Don't forget the power of illustration
	+ particularly when the subject is something we see a lot - and as a result are numb to
	+ illustration can be more relevant and appropriate to its content; it can provide powerful emotion support to editorials

[back to top](#top)

### Imagery DOs and DON'Ts

- [https://material.io/design/communication/imagery.html#principles](https://material.io/design/communication/imagery.html#principles)
- DO: Show an actual person when the reference to that person is specific
- DO: Use illustration when specificity isn't possible, or doesn't apply
- DO: Look for images that represent and tell realistic stories
- DON'T: Use posed, staged stock images that feel faked and unemotional
- DO: If you're referencing a specific produt, show *that specific product*
- DON'T: default to generic, literal stock photos
- DO: Use color and composition to create a focal point that communicates meaning
- DON'T: make the user hunt for the hidden meaning(s) in your image
- DO: Use images with only a few meaningful elements, with minimal distractions
- DON'T: obscure the point of focus, which also obscures meaning and diminishes power
- DO: Strive for clear visual focus, which communicates the concept at a glance
- DON'T: use photos whose lack of focus makes the image meaningless
- DO: Build a narrative; imply an interesting, informative story
- DON'T: Use images without context; these don't convey mood, brand, and context
- DO: show a product and people in the context of a real-world situation
- DON'T: show a product and its user disassociated from that context; it's not interesting
	+ think of the car seat - one has the mother with the child, the other has just the baby in the car seat looking at the camera

## Creating and Simplifying Visual Cues

### Working With Icons

- Microsoft -> put the icon and then associated text/description
- icons make excellent touch targets
- icons save space
- icons are quick to recognize
- icons should clearly convey meaning

### Four Core Types of Icons (and How to Choose The Right Type)

- Similar icons are useful for simple, easily understood actions and concepts
	+ turn right, no smoking, hand in gears
- Symbolic icons represent an action, object or concept at high abstraction
	+ hamburger symbol, lock, printer
- Example use images taht exeplify or are commonly associated with an action, object, or concept
	+ airplane to represent an airport, scissors + dotted line for "cutting" something, mail symbol for email
- Arbitrary icons bear no resemblance to the represented concept; their meaning is learned through repeated exposure
	+ USB symbol, bluetooth, male/female
- Icon choice starts with their environment
	+ App icons should be based on Android or iOS icons
	+ Laptop software should use Microsoft, Google Chrome
	+ Website should be based on commonly used icons
- Quick Rule of THumb
	+ if you choose more than 15 minutes to pick an icon, you probably need a different icon
- Label + icon is hard to beat
	+ a text label goes a long way in properly setting user expectation and enabling them to predict the result of the interaction
- **UI Design Mantra #16: Icons must be recognizable and memorable.**

### Five Rules for Effective Icon Design

- 1. Keep visual / perceived size consistent
	+ icons that occupy the same pixel space on the grid aren't necessarily perceived as being the same size
	+ check optical size with shapes - look for equal visual weight
	+ check width of rules (strokes) used in the icon
		* when rule width varies, icons will be perceived as different size
- 2. Keep the level of detail consistent
	+ More detailed icons will atract the user's attention first - because they appear to have more visual weight than the others
- 3. Eliminate unnecessary detail
	+ think context: what really needs to be there?
		* if you are working in an email app, do you really need the envelope for all icons?
- 4. Don't mix and match styles
	+ fill and non filled style; it's okay for hover/active
- 5. Don't reinvent the wheel
	+ if the concept or action depicted is common, near-unversal, stick with the established icon
		* anything else invites confusion

### Dealing with Data

- The greatest value of a picture is when it forces us to notice what we never expected to see
- the "three legged stool"
	+ book: Designing Data Visualizations: Representing Informational Relationships
	+ Data - Designer - Viewer
- Persuasive
	+ Designer to Viewer
	+ represents a specific point of view
	+ meant to change opinion or reinforce an existing opinion
	+ bias can be unintentional
- Informative
	+ Viewer to Data
	+ Neutral presentation of facts
	+ meant to educate as opposed to persuade (watch bias!)
	+ example: Google Analytics
- Visual Art
	+ Designer to Data
	+ Encoding takes precedence over decoding
	+ when intentional, the intended outcome is usually just enjoyment
	+ When unintentional, can have serious, negative consequences
- Context of use dictates visual form
	+ What does the viewer need to understand - how quickly or easily?
	+ Example: bar chart vs. pie graph
	+ What matters most - to us and to the viewer?
- Do the visuals accurately reflect the numbers?
	+ bad example: 3-D bar chart vs. regular 2-D => 2-D is simple, flat and easier to read
- **UI Design Mantra #17: Context of use dictates visual form.**

### Five Rules for Great Data Design

- 1. Data is only useful if it can be understood
	+ if I don't understand it, I can't act on it
	+ If I can't act on it, it's practically worthless
	+ Data isn't the goal - it's a tool that helps us understand and make change in the world
	+ Data without design is noise
- 2. You're designing for other people
	+ you have to design for their identity, motivation, language, and learned social contexts (colo associations, icon recognition, reading patterns, etc.)
- 3. You're designing for their context of use
	+ what amount of infomration does the user need in order to understand or act?
	+ what motivaitons is he/she coming to the table with?
	+ how do those motivations influence how useful or actionable the visualization is?
	+ How much time does he/she have to spend with this information?
- 4. The usefulness of data decreases when its volume increases
	+ the more information is any given view, the harder it is for viewers to find what they care most about
- 5. The more brainpower required to decode your visualization, the less that's available for understanding it
