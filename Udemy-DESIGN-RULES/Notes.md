## Ground Rules: What You Need to Know Upfront

### Design is Design is Design

- "If you can design one thing, you can design *everything*." - Massimo Vignelli
- design is **solving problems**. Not drawing pictures
- Design is a problem-solving discipline
	+ does the design serve the purpose of its existence?
	+ how should it be perceived (and received) by the viewer/audience
	+ what does that matter to anyone?
- "If you don't have a good solution, yo don't have a good problem."
	+ what is it supposed to do?
	+ You need to properly define the problem
- The principles of **good graphic design** are the same principles that dictate **good UI design**
- nothing in UI design should be arbitrary or "just because it looks cool"
- design is design is design.
	- It doesn't matter, they're all the same; you are always starting by figuring out what people are trying to accomplish
* **UI Design Mantra #1: Design is Design is Design**

### Stop Solving Other People's Problems

- don't look at themes
	+ themes look nice - but they offer no explanation of what, how and why
		* they don't tell us anything about the problems they were solving to create them
- Do you start the design process by looking at the work of other designers
+ don't look for inspiration
	* you will only find someone else's solution to someone else's problem
	* the problem you have to solve belongs exclusively to you, your client and your users
	* "Do not seek to follow in the footsteps of the wise. Seek what they sought.
+ Don't look at trends
	* flat design has become a widespread trend
		- designers are adopting th elook without considering whether it's appropriate for the situation or whether people understand what they see
		- flat design without visual affordances makes it difficult for the user to understand what they're seeing is interactive
+ Design vs decoration
	* designer = things hard about the appropriateness of the visual decisions they make, and those decisions are informed by research, investigation and fact
		- context of use
	* decorator = relies on his/her instincts as to what looks good and what doesn't. Most designers who've never learned the timeless principles of design are in this category
+ **UI Design Mantra #2: Stop Solving Other People's Problems**

### Form Doesn't (and Shouldn't) Follow Function?

- On the surface, "form follows function" seems to make a lot of sense
- In terms of UI design, it's applied like this:
	+ "gather" the product's requirements from the client, then
	+ Determine the aesthetics of the UI based on those requirements
	+ it's not that simple
- "Form follows function" has been:
	+ co-opted
	+ misinterpreted
	+ misapplied
- In order to understand it, understand how it came to be:
	+ Louis Sullivan start it all in 1986
	+ Sullivan was a rebel, bucking the forms of buildings still based on ancient Greek and Roman architecture
	+ Believed new form for buildings was needed
	+ Frank Lloyd Wright: form and function should be one
	+ Guggenheim museum is a spiral so that people could easily see the art
	+ Adolf Loos was againsg ornamentation
	+ Walt Gropius founded bauhaus: architecture beigns where the engineering ends
		* Bauhaus was a school of multidisciplinary design
		* Form had to reflect the function of the product
		* Bauhaus was the foundation for modern graphic design
			- connection between color and shape
			- clean, powerful typography
			- spatial relationships and integration of shape, colo, and typography
			- core principles of visual design such as harmony, balance, rhythm, proportion, symmetry and synthesis
	+ modern graphic design is the foundation of US Design
	+ Universal Principles of Design = get this book!

### Balancing Form and Function: Prescription vs. Description

- the thing that will make you a great designer is your understanding of the "why" you are making the visual decisions you make
- Description
	+ beauty results from purity of function (not ornamentation)
	+ this derives from the believe that form follows function in nature
- Prescription
	+ aesthetic considerations should be secondary to functional considerations
	+ **This is the one that's gotten us into so much trouble**
- Description
	+ Nature => variations in form allow some species to succeed, survive and flourish
	+ Product Design => variations in form of products compete for sales
- Prescription
	+ Dogma => prioritize functionality over all other design considerations
		* insist aesthetic considerations in design should be secondary to functional considerations
	+ Product Design => designers and developer are led to ask a very wrong question: what elements here don't specifically serve a function - and should be removed?
- Logically....
	- if the form of a design was ruled solely by its function, then every functional item would have one and only one design solution
	- every element would ultimately have the same design

### Why Form Follows Function is NOT a UI Design Prescription

- Reality Check #1 - Users are most often frustrated and confused when confronted with visual form that strictly reflects technical function
- Design according to implementation
	+ Implementation Model (reflects technology) vs. Mental Model (user's understanding)
- Do you really need to know the mechanics of how something works in order to use it?
	+ Answer: **NO**
- As users, we don't care how it works
	+ our focus is on the experience
	+ we have a mental model that predicts the experience and tells us what we can expect
	+ When the UI sticks close to our mental model, it's easier
- Reality Check #2: Form should be determined by success criteria - not by function or personal aesthetic preferences
	+ be interested in outcomes, not features
	+ Form follows function only works in situations where something only has one function
	+ convenience trumps best practice all the time
- What visually communicates value?
- Reality Check #3: Function is onlly a single, isolated aspect of what drives and influences form

### Every Force Evloves Form (So Don't Follow the Prescription)

- Every force evolves a form
- what really drives form?
	+ audience needs
	+ client desires
	+ ethical obligations
	+ aesthetic inclinations
	+ technology constraints
	+ cultural presuppositions
	+ functional requirements
	+ material properties
	+ available time
	+ available budget
	+ available resources
- The form of a digital product is a balance between:
	+ UI design
	+ information architecture
	+ front-end HTML/CSS
	+ middle tier logic
	+ backend data structures
	+ programming and processes
- Don't use form follows function as a prescription
	+ focus on the relative importance of form and function
- Allow the **description** of "form follows function" to guide your efforts
- **UI Design Mantra #4: Force Evolves Form**

### Less is More: Small Screens, Big Challenges

- research has shows that visual complexity can obstruct a user's perception within 50 milliseconds of exposure
- if it looks too complex we assume it's hard to user (or at least time-consuming)
- but this isn't about simplicity for simplicity's sake
- but don't get too far
	+ common UI elements: buttons, menus, common actions, are a very significant part of what makes a site or app useful
- Hiding elements can be costly
	+ icons without labels are worse than labels alone
- Expecting users to discover interactions through trial and error is a recipe for disaster

### Five Rules for Effective UI Design on Small Screens

- #1. Focus on context of use
	+ when are people using the app/site?
	+ are they stressed? bored? busy? lost?
	+ the available features and functions - and the way they work - should fit the situation
- #2. Simplify, simplify, simplify
	+ each screen should contain one primary action
	+ every screen should provide something useful, meaningful, and valuable
	+ abandon the idea that the number of screen (or steps) matters. It doesn't
- #3. Design for thumbs?
	+ most people rely on one or both thumbs to interact on phones
- #4. Design for fat fingers
	+ minimum 48px in diameter
	+ anything smaller makes it hard to tap easily and accurately
	+ provide ample space between targets so users don't accidentally tap the wrong target
- #5. Minimize the need to type
	+ it's a slow, error-prone process
	+ keep forms short and simple
	+ use auto-complete and personalized data where possible
